I applied thru anthro (and stated I wanted to be considered for FES as well) and was interviewed by anthro. But the moment I got into anthro, it pretty much guaranteed FES would take me too since anthro is the one funding me. Conversely, if you applied thru FES for the combined program, you'd be vetted by FES, but I have no idea whether they've started interviewing people. There is no difference between being an intl vs domestic applicant for the private institutions. (I am international and this has no bearing whatsoever.)"

In the email she let me know that I had not been accepted as I was not perceived as a potential competitive anthropology student. I have a BA in Comparative Literature and am doing my MA in Cultural Theory so I see why they might prefer someone else, given that there are so many great students out there with a background in Anthropology. It should be noted, that I have had my work published as peer reviewed articles and I have also been presenting this at conferences, so I am confident that the level of my work (i.e. writing sample) had nothing to do with it.

Re:  Application for Graduate Studies
    Your application for admission to our graduate program has been received and
carefully considered by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
I regret to inform you that the Department is not able to recommend your admission
to the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research.
    We receive many applications each year and the Graduate Studies Admissions
Committee takes every effort to evaluate each application objectively for a
limited number of spaces.  Failure to be admitted to our graduate program does
not reflect upon your professional qualifications but rather reflects the intense
competition for graduate positions.  The decision was based on the strong competition
for very few openings. 
    Thank you for your interest in the University of Alberta, and best wishes
for your future career plans. 
 
 Yours sincerely,
 
 N McDonagh for the,
 Associate Chair (Graduate Studies)"

Anyways if you are still waiting for a decision, don't lose hope. I had to wait for almost 4 months but didn't lose hope keeping in mind that they didn't reject me yet. So, all the best to everyone of you. Keeping praying to the Almighty and don't lose hope.

Having said all this, I think The admission committee should make a quick decision for the international students as the visa process is lenghty.

But I really am worried, cause I checked my mail and they literally contacted me 2 days after the Academic interview for the personal date, I'm just thinking the worst cause when they asked if I applied for other universites I said yes as a back up plan so maybe they will think I don't want it enough, also I mentioned getting Educational diploma to prepare for becoming a teacher ( as another back-up plan if everything else didn't work and i couldn't find a decent job ) I couldn't say all that , cause as soon as I said I got that and she asked what's the use of that and i said it's to prepare me into becoming a teacher she cut me saying ah I see and moved on .. so yeah they probably don't like me so I'm not gonna keep my hopes up 😔 even tho I really wanted to get in ..
Okay I'm sorry I keep on bothering you with my questions and I might bother you one more time later on if I got a good news ( or bad ) I'll try to share it here , I hope everything work out well for you tho "" I know you got accepted, I mean everything else 😊 "" and have a nice day !  

And for the other person asking about why they haven't contacted him/her yet. I'm not sure but try calling these numbers 0128083446 / 0128083422 / 0128083463 ( they all start with 00966 if you're not from Saudi Arabia , so the first number for example will be 00966128083446 ) those are all the numbers I use to call and got a call from KAUST thro . So i hope that helps and good luck !"

Ops, one more question * sorry * okay about the invitation, how was it ? I know that they get your fly tickets but I mean do they decide which day exactly and what time or did they ask when is the good time for you? Were they flexible about it? thing is that I might get really busy and maybe need to fly somewhere but nothing is certain.  So if that happened can I ask for a reschedule or do I have to drop everything and go whenever they say I have ? One more thing, is the third interview like the second or a mix of the first and second? I mean do I have to prepare for in-depth questions in my field or is it just like the personal interview and i don't really need to. And what did they ask you?

I have a question. a couple of questions actually. So, I had my second interview yesterday and in my opinion it went horrible unlike the first one cause I was confident and the professor was nice, however the interview I had yesterday was a mess , it was scheduled to start at 9 and I was waiting nervously since 8 and NOTHING, then I tried calling and emailing them and still nothing and after a while I got a call back from the number I tried and the lady asked for my info to ensure that I really have an interview and after a few calls she finally told me it might start after 10 cause they were interviewing a couple of ppl at a time.. and as soon as I was okay I'll chill now and left my laptop I heard the call, ofc I answered but I wasn't mentally ready. so I forgot how to speak xD literally! I was throwing words even though I know in my head that I could do better but that was it, I was nervous and i was smiling like an idiot trying to impress them but words won't connect into decent sentences so yeah.. so first question, do you know if I will get rejected cause I couldn't speak like a human being? I'm sure it's not as bad as I think it was but still.. and how many days did you wait in between the 2nd and third interview? also, how much time does the third interview and english exam take? I'm also saudi so I will have to take it there since I didn't do any other exam beside STEP and haven't submitted it. Also, what is the medical record? do I have to get checked or they will take my word for it? I'm too lazy to do that but I'm sure I have nothing to worry about al7mdollellah. And thanks!"

I was informed that there would be one but then in 6 business days they are able go recalculate everyones scores, notify the people they entered incorrectly, and then send all admission decisions? When I emailed the office of provost today the response I received was ""all is in order and compliant with our own policies"" so I'm glad that miscalculating scores and waitlisting a student who shouldn't have been waitlisted and admitting two students who shouldn't have been admitted is compliant with their own policies. I have sent a formal complaint to the Board of Governors, I don't think much will come out of it for this year, only that hopefully this situation will never occur again at FAU. If you are shocked by your results, I highly suggest you calculate your scores. Scores are calculated as follows: GPA x 20, + Verbal score + Quant score + (writing score x 2) + recommendation score (which is a maximum of 5 points). The acceptance threshold score is 403.5 and the waitlist threshold score is 395. I've literally done everything that I could do to make this right but FAU doesnt care and I am just one small person.

Thank you for your letter. After careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me an assistant professor position in your department.

This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large number of rejection letters. With such a varied and promising field of candidates, it is impossible for me to accept all refusals.

Despite Kaust’s outstanding qualifications and previous experience in rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet my needs at this time. Therefore, I will assume the position of assistant professor in your department this Fall. I look forward to seeing you then.

Best of luck in rejecting future applicants.

Sincerely,"
