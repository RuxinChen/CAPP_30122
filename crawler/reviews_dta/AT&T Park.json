I was sitting next to two mothers and their young children. About 2nd inning 5 young and drunk people decided to move down to empty seats behind us and preceded to use foul and nasty language toward Dodger players and 3rd base coach...on numerous occasions, I and others would turn and tell these nitwits to watch the language...they would quiet down for a few minutes, then start up again. They even told their friends that they had strangers buy more for them...cut off? Finally around the 7th inning they were tossed out of our area and out of the park, but it was too late for me and the moms/kids, we left. Giants should do better crown control of drunk, obnoxious \"fans\" (???). It didn't ruin my experience but sure put a dent into my enjoyment, I gave a \"very good\" rating for the park, seats, but please try to control the \"nitwit\" factor, and have ushers patrol the area more to spot unruly behavior.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 22, 2017", 5.0, "1st ball game", "Attended a ball game for the experience and really enjoyed the experience.
