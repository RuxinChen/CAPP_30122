My fianc\u00e9 injured his leg prior to our trip and had to be put in a full leg cast which resulted in us using a wheelchair throughout the trip. From beginning to end, the employees at Alcatraz Cruises were helpful and thoughtful during our visit.

Again, every employee we encountered was friendly and helpful. We started our tour and long story short, he loved it. The tour is a little confusing, to say the least. It makes you go in circles rather than simply going in one direction the entire time which was a little irritating to me. After my visit to Eastern State Penitentiary last year, I personally wasn't too impressed with Alcatraz. It's beautiful with great views of the city and bridges, but the tour felt messy and it was \"too\" touristy.\n\nOverall, I do think everyone visiting San Fran should make the trip to Alcatraz.

When we went we were blessed to find out one of the former inmates was signing books in the bookstore. It was overall a lovely experience, and my middle-aged, blue-collar, East Coast boyfriend had a fantastic time. He poured over the details of the cells, he was completely absorbed with the escape stories. It was a very manly visit for a very manly man. He had A blast. I will add a weird aside in that I am a heart patient. Having a golf cart be able to take me from the dock up to the prison, and back again made the tour possible for me. Having a park ranger remember that I rode the golf cart and pluck me out of the long, long line for the ferry to go sit on a bench and then cut the line to board the ferry Meant I did not go home completely wiped out from the physical exertion. It was a sweet and unexpected bonus to have a park ranger pay so much attention. It\u2019s not an act of kindness I will forget anytime soon.\nShow less"]]}}
