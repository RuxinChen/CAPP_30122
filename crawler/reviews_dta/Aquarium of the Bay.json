Lots of local fish including large sturgeon and a variety of bay sharks. Some of the exhibits missed the mark. I didn't visit to see South American tortoises or pet-store chinchillas or an interactive dinosaur animation. I was looking for all local aquatic and riparian critters. The ray petting pools and tide pool mock-up are cool. On the down-side, the exhibit plaques are written to uphold Eco-extremism ideals, painting fishermen as villains. So when you finish the exhibit, go to any local diner & have a big fish dinner, without which Fisherman's Wharf would not exist.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 1 week ago", 3.0, "Not that great....", "If I had a do-over, I would have skipped this aquarium.

Be sure to check the schedule as you enter the place. On your way out of the museum, on the same Entrance Level, you'll find a gift shop.

If you're at the pier it's a great place to spend a little time and learn something besides shopping for knickknacks on the boardwalk!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 3, 2016", 3.0, "Average aquarium", "It was nice, but small. A little pricey for what it is, espwcially for a family of 5, but the displays they do have were nice. Definitely a tourist trap, but was worth doing once."], ["Reviewed July 30, 2016", 4.0, "Worth a visit without being totally awesome", "We were in two minds as to whether to visit the Aquarium as some reviews had not been great but we were glad we went.\n\nThe staff were engaging throughout and in the aquarium itself, there were several staff explaining about the sealife and the Bay area, which we found to be quite helpful.\n\nYou can skip through the whole thing in about 30 minutes if you want to, or take a little longer to look at the various fish, listen to the guides and read the display texts - but you would be hard pressed to make your visit last more than an hour or so.\n\nThe real treat is the underwater walkway where you can see all the larger fish (and some small sharks) although a firm favourite of the family was the pool immediately after, where small rays were swimming around and bobbing out of the water as if to say hello to you.\n\nThere are other, more impressive aquarium, but the bias to the Bay makes this a worthwhile place to visit and we were glad not to be put off.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 29, 2016", 4.0, "Small but interesting Aquarium", "The Aquarium takes about an hour to go around. Very clean and well laid out. With time precious it is a good place to go you have limited time. Worth the visit"], ["Reviewed July 27, 2016", 3.0, "A Decent Replacement For Monterey Bay Aquarium", "Though this place does not have the same grandeur ambiance of the Monterey Bay Aquarium 2 hours south of San Francisco, it is a decent substitution if you need to visit an aquarium. It has many of the same exhibits as Monterey Bay Aquarium except in a lot smaller scale. They have a decent jellyfish exhibit, a very small anchovy round-about swim tank, a hands-on touch tank and a very good glass observation tunnel. The first tunnel displays many of the local rock fish which is ok but nothing to rave about. However, the second tunnel includes large bat rays, sharks and bass fish, and it is a very strange feeling having a large bat ray swim directly at you as if it's going to ram you only to be stopped by the glass. If you cannot get to Monterey and need to go to an aquarium, this could be a good substitution, especially if you have young children...\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 27, 2016", 2.0, "OK if you have the right expectations", "It took me about 30 min. to see everything. It's a nice and very small aquarium, so go in with this expectation. Look online for a discount coupon rather than paying full price. It's also kind of funny that all of the marketing materials talk about the 'Sharks of Alcatraz' showing a big set of jaws, and you learn that the most common shark in the bay is actually pretty small and not very ferocious. Kids will like the walk through tunnels.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 24, 2016", 3.0, "Average", "Went to aquarium after Alcatraz. It was small and pretty average. It seemed expensive for the size of the aquarium ($25). Three small floors.

The observation tunnel is amazing, really long and lots of interesting sea life all from the local area.

It just seemed kind of boring. There were 2 long tunnels to walk through. There were a few interesting fish to see but it didn't seem like a lot of variety. Definitely did not see more than a couple of sharks and rays. It was crowded and just not really enjoyable for me.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 23, 2016", 3.0, "Okay but expensive and too small", "There are so many better aquariums in the world, it is hard to keep up with the others. I think the sting ray exhibit was good, and that was about it. They have one of those transparent walkways, which is good, but the type of fish is limited. Far too expensive however.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 23, 2016", 5.0, "Amazing", "We love this place! Every time we go to San Francisco we visit. It is like having a peaceful moment in a very busy city. The jellyfish are my favorite as I can watch them fluff about for hours. It is clean and very family friendly!
