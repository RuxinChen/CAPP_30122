The facility was extremely clean and the staff and volunteers were knowledgeable and helpful. There are touch tanks and displays which offer an opportunity to experience something out of the ordinary.\nThge only downside to our visit was that it was a field trip day and the Aquarium had 900 elementary students expected that day. The result was that the facility was a bit crowded and noisy, making it difficult to linger at some of the displays.\nBonus tip. We purchased a whale watching combo ticket for $49.95 which gave us a 3 hour cruise into the Pacific where we saw a few Gray Whales.

Only waste of time was the shark-feeding - they literally drag fish corpses in and out of the water trying to get them to eat - sometimes they do, but you don't really get to see in action.

Granted we were three adults and did not spend a lot of time in the touch/petting areas but we did take time to view all the exhibits, see the scuba diver and talk to volunteers. Other than the identifying plaque, there is very little additional information given about the animals. The cost seemed a little high for the size of the aquarium and variety of animals present. $30 adults $17 kids 3 to 12 and $27 for seniors 62 and older. We did get a AAA discount and I understand if you go directly to a California AAA office ahead of time, the discount is greater. Aquarium is open 9 to 6.

Complimentary wheelchairs are available but you must present a credit card. Complimentary strollers or not but they do have what they call baby back packs you can use (credit card deposit). Since one of the focuses of the trip was to see jellyfish we were not disappointed here. There were more varieties them we\u2019ve seen in many other aquariums very interesting to watch. They also do a great job with the horses. While few in numbers the sea lions and seals were fun to watch. The sea otters were very playful with the kids. There were also no large sharks but they did have a few impressive stingrays. Penguins were hard to see except when they were in the water.

The \"shows\" are to teach for instance, how to feed, and how to take care of the different animals. The shows around the tanks are \"interactive\", and when the scuba diver is in the tank, s/he speaks with the audience/public, and answers the questions, especially from the children.

The aquarium was really crowded -- mostly with families with lots and lots of strollers and young kids. (I'm not sure why people take kids that are under 5). It was not the peaceful, serene experience I'd imagined, staring into tranquil aquariums with gurgling peaceful music playing in the background, with educational talks by scientist types. No, it was a noisy, bustling, chaotic, bordering on unpleasant experience with smart phones in your face. The educators were either volunteers or under-25s in skinny jeans, their talks clearly aimed at the 4-12 year olds.\n\nGOING THROUGH A RENOVATION (SUMMER 2017)\nThe outside is currently being renovated, so there are temporary porta-kiosks where you pay. Fortunately, we had a coupon for $8 off that we found in the Long Beach Visitor Guide, which took some of the sting out of the expensive admission. ($29.95 in 2017).\n\nGO ELSEWHERE FOR FOOD - SKIP THE SCUBA CAFE\nI would skip the 'Scuba Cafe' as it was just as chaotic with mediocre food. It was difficult to find a table and then we waited for our food to the sound of more screaming kids. The overly-fishy smelling fish tacos were something to put in our stomachs, but nothing to write home about. On reflection, we should have had our hands stamped and gone somewhere else.\n\nMORE RESTROOMS NEEDED\nThere should be more restroom stalls for ladies as there were continuous lines outside the door. When I did finally get in a stall, (one of those with huge gaps around the edge so everyone can see in while you're doing your thing!) a yellow pool of liquid was rapidly rolling towards my feet from the stall next to me. A mother used a paper towel under her foot to mop it up, luckily right before it reached me. Ugh!\n\nTHE SEA LIFE\nIf you can see past all the strollers and smart phones, you may enjoy the sea life. We did enjoy seeing the different exhibits about sharks, penguins, frogs, sea lions, seahorses, tropical fish, etc. Our favorites were probably the different varieties of jelly fish, especially the ones that 'light up'.\n\nEXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP\nThere is a large gift shop with all things sea-themed, toys, books, housewares, T-shirts, key-rings, the usual touristy trinkets.\n\nGO WHILE SCHOOL IS IN SESSION\nWe left the aquarium having spent about 5 hours there including time for lunch. I would recommend other child-free adults to go on a weekday during the off-season. To be honest, we were kind of glad to leave.\n\nIf you found this review useful, please click the 'thank' button.
