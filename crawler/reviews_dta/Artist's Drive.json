First of all, if you compare this to some of the other points such as Zabriskie Point, Dante's View, Badwater Basin or the Devil's Golf Course, it's just about average. You can easily skip this if you're on a tight schedule like we were. It's a nine mile one-way road so there's no going back in case you regret it, which we did. It's the biggest mistake we made at Death Valley. We ended up having to skip Badwater Basin because of this. It was getting dark, and we had to drive home. If you do have enough time (e.g. an entire day at Death Valley), then you might as well see this. Artist's Pallette is supposed to be really beautiful in the late afternoon because of all the different colours, but we didn't really see anything special, to be honest. The colour green was about the only one that stood out.\n\nA few general tips for Death Valley:\n- Death Valley holds the record for the highest reliably recorded air temperature in the world (134\u00b0F / 56.7\u00b0C). Therefore, make sure you have lots of food and especially water. Wear breathable clothes.\n- If your car doesn't have a GPS, use real maps or offline Google maps since you won't be able to connect to the internet. We used offline Google maps.\n- Bring a nice camera so you get some unforgettable photos!\n\nAbout our road trip:\n- 3 friends, 8 days, 14 states, and over 5000 miles.\n- Since we knew our trip would be very hectic, we only visited what we thought were the best places at each location.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 25, 2017", 4.0, "Green Color Was the Most Interesting", "There were multiple colors, but wasn't as vibrant or colorful as I had expected.

There is really nothing else here. Personally not my high point but worth the drive.
