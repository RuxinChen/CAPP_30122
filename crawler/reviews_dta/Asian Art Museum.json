As a Roman history enthusiast I am always thrilled to explore an exhibit about another culture from the same time period so I can compare their arts and technological development.\n\nSan Francisco is just a little over an hour's flight from my home in Oregon so I decided to make a day trip out of it. I caught an early morning flight then walked over to the BART station adjacent to the international terminal at the airport. In about forty minutes i was climbing out of the underground train station downtown and had just a short 3-minute walk to the museum. It was a little foggy but warm enough I only needed a sweater.\n\nAs I entered the exhibit I spotted a beautiful gilded bronze lamp in the shape of a deer from the Western Han period (2nd century BCE). It was just the first of many amazing objects I would see that day. I was also excited to see an assembled jade burial suit that had once encased the body of a queen of the Jiangdu kingdom. These suits are rare since they have been the prime targets of tomb robbers over the centuries. A jade coffin reassembled from about 1500 jade tiles remaining in the looted tomb of the King of Chu was also on display. I enjoyed examining a lot of small gold figurines many shaped like stylized tigers that I learned were used as mat weights. People in the Han dynasty did not use chairs, sitting instead on the floor on carpets secured at four corners by mat weights. Most of the weights on display were recovered from royal tombs so many were made of gold or gilded bronze and some of them were also inlaid with silver. Music was very important in Han society and there was an ornate set of bells on display. I learned that these specially-crafted bells actually produced different tones if tapped on different sides. I actually got a chance to try this out with a smaller replica in the children's education center that visitors are encouraged to play.\n\nNon-flash photography was allowed in this exhibit and I took several hundred photographs in the two hours I spent in the galleries. Then I took a break for lunch and enjoyed a marvelous bowl of Fujian coconut pork stew in the museum's cafe. I always enjoy eating there as they have a nice selection of ethnic entrees to choose from. If you prefer more traditional fare they also have sandwiches, salads, and soups. The museum also has a large gift shop stocked with apparel, jewelry, books, and folk art.\n\nAfter lunch, I took the escalator to the third floor and revisited their permanent collections. I was pleased to see not only old favorites but items I had not yet seen before in previous visits. I was particularly interested in a silver ceremonial bowl with Zoroastrian symbols and an intricate relief depicting scenes of the Persian emperor Darius and another scene of the Persian emperor Shapur I humbling the Roman emperor Valerian. I was really surprised when I discovered the object was actually crafted in Burma in the late 19th century. I am always astonished by the variety of objects in the Museum's permanent collections.\n\nBy four o'clock I was getting pretty tired so I made my way back to the train station and was soon back at the airport ready to wing my way home.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 4, 2018", 5.0, "Jammed with fascinating art", "SOOO much to see in this museum, both permanent and revolving.

Nice gift shop, too.\n\nOne thing to be aware of if this is a first time visit to San Francisco: All the stuff folks like in SF comes with a price - and that price is a lot of suffering. We have huge income inequality, lots of homeless folks, and a big opioid problem. Many parts of the country and the world do but we REALLY do. People are shocked by it.

Overall, it was a spectacular exhibit and featured exquisite jade, gold, and bronze figurines and common items (like cooking vessels and lamps) that the nobility used. There were also short videos explaining and demonstrating the types of weaponry and forms of entertainment during the Han dynasty. It was mind-boggling to realize that for an ancient civilization existing before AD even began, the nobility had intricate musical instruments and even wine containers. The reason I'm giving this exhibit 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because in the third room, I inwardly screamed \"Ai Yah!\" (Yikes in Chinese). I was SHOCKED that they had sexual toys on display. Shocked that they used these sort of things back then but SHOCKED that I had to think about whether I wanted my children to view such things and ask me questions about them.

At the top of my list was a visit to the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco. The collection had long been housed in a wing of the de Young Museum in Golden Gate park. The collection which I remember as being primarily Chinese was formed by Avery Brundage, a philanthropist, world traveler, and notably an avid supporter and promoter of the Olympic Games. The collection was notable but was also thought to be not a true survey. Nor was it thought to be of the best quality. But it formed a beginning and a core from which to build. As space was limited in the de Young the collection was never seen to broadest or best effect. After the 1989 earthquake, the de Young was closed and the Asian collection found itself without a home. This presented a grand opportunity to rethink the collection and its display and to rethink its importance to the cultural life of the city. The museum trustees and city officials came to the decision to move the museum to the Civic Center into the former public library a very fine and grand beaux art building which is a part of the great ensemble of beaux arts buildings that surround the Civic Center Park. The idea of displaying Asian art in a French beaux arts environment met with vociferous complaint from the art world and from local activists. But the project went forward. After bringing the building up to earthquake proof standards the non-landmarked interiors were redesigned and now offer a sweeping and beautiful survey of Asian art. The result is magnificent and brilliantly realized. The circuit begins with the theme of the rise of Buddhist art in Gandhara and moves on to Hinduism and the spread of both religions to the countries of southeast Asia, notably Kymer Cambodia and Indonesian kingdoms. There are also rich galleries devoted to Japanese and especially to Korean art, of great importance and rarity. The core of the museum consists of galleries dedicated to the arts of China which are shown in a series of wonderful rooms displaying archaic jades, snuff bottles, temple and funerary goods, decorative arts and some paintings. The cases and displays are both dramatic and entertaining and logical in their progression. These galleries end with a survey of Buddhist sculpture, of which are the examples are very fine. I have a special interest in Chinese porcelain, one of the signal achievements of Chinese manufactures, and highly recommend visiting the great central staircase upper hall where thematic essays on Chinese porcelain are displayed with simplicity and clarity. The explanatory texts are particularly well-written as are all the texts in the museum. The curators have worked assiduously to build a great collection on the foundation of the Brundage Collection. The results of this effort are evident at every turn and the collections now present a fuller, richer history of East Asia through art. The effort to do this has been considerable and dedicated. The museum represents one of the finest of a very few museums dedicated to Asian art. Because San Francisco is an Asian-Pacific Rim city with a large population of citizens coming from Asia, it has a special importance in the cultural life of San Francisco. I highly recommend it to the interested visitor, even if the visitor has no expertise in Asian art. The important aspect for me is that the Asian Art Museum speaks to San Francisco as an international, cosmopolitan and sophisticated city with abroad and diverse population. Practically I would suggest a 1 1/2 block of time for a visit. There is a cafe in the museum. It must be very fine because at 1:30 the line was long and I could not get near it and because I had much to accomplish I pushed on.
