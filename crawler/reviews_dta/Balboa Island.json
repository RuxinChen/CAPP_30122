We parked at the Edgewater Garage which has valet and is covered. I was worried they would be full by our late afternoon arrival, but they weren\u2019t. They are very close to Davey\u2019s Locker and were very helpful in telling me how to get there. So thanks to Davey\u2019s Locker for that small tidbit of advice, as it made our visit much easier.\n\nOur cruise was on the Ocean Explorer and the max amount of guests per cruise is 102 for that vessel per a crew member I asked. It\u2019s a big boat and had a comfortable crowd. We met both really nice people and people who need lessons in politeness during our cruise. The crew was great at all times...I\u2019m referring to my fellow passengers. Some were out and out rude. Really, no one is more entitled than any one else, but some people sure acted like it.\n\nThe only suggestion I would have for Davey\u2019s is a new playlist of Christmas songs that plays as you cruise. It\u2019s a nice idea and one I wasn\u2019t expecting, but includes way too many Country selections and some songs that were downright sad and close to depressing. With all the Christmas music out there I think they should revamp it a bit.\n\nOverall this was a fun experience and one I would do again snd encourage others to experience. If you go, the best views will be on the right side facing the front of the boat. You are free to move around during the cruise, but I noticed this side seemed to have the best views throughout.

Newport Coastal Adventures which is located on the island is fantastic for a good whale watching and boating experience. The ferry which only cost 1 dollar to ride will get you to the other side of the harbor and within walking distance of the beach in addition to more shops and eating options. The only thing to keep in mind is parking can be a bit problematic so keep that in mind and get there early just in case you have to hunt for a spot to park.

Most of the adventurous young were enjoying swimming, surfing, challenging the gusty sea waves. Few people were strolling along the beach and still many more seated far away from the lashing waves on a beach chair gazing at the wild sea, lost in their own world. One can find little ones busy making sand castles with their own play way tools.At a short distance was a Fishing Pier.It is basically a long wooden platform jutting into the sea. There are many joints,shops, restaurants,bars all around.\n\nThe sea was boisterous, huge waves were hitting the shore, may be because of high tide.All of a sudden a SEAL appeared along with the waves.It remained on the shore, for a short while, too perplexed to watch so many human beings, none resembling creatures of its own sea world. It gave a photogenic pose to many peoples delight and vanished in the sea along with the receding waves.For me it was once in a lifetime, memorable experience, watching a SEAL in its natural habitat.\nAll in all this place is a best way to spend an afternoon if you are around New Port Beach,CA.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 31, 2017", 5.0, "Create unique shops and food.", "We come here every trip to California.

Not enough residence to support a continued zip code of its own, the little hamlet of Balboa, including the island, still holds its individuality. Its neighboring community to the north whose zip code it shares \u2026 92662, has not gobbled it up \u2026 though is a draw for locals and tourists, alike.\nBalboa in December was a bit cold due to the Santa Anna\u2019s that blew in our first night. They blew in and we blew out the power, though that is another story. Luckily, my friend\u2019s relative lived close (just 20 minutes away) and we moved in with her for our weeklong stay in the area. This made it easy to return to Balboa.\nWe spent two separate days in the Balboa area. One day we took a walk along the ocean side of the area \u2013 Newport Beach. Being December, there were no crowds. Several bicyclists and other walkers enjoying the area. There were surfers, as well, waiting for a wave, which were few and far between. To my surprise, my friend who has had access to a beach house in this area all of her life never had ventured over to the ocean side. This made it more enjoyable to see her reactions along our walk.\nIt isn\u2019t that I had never seen the ocean before; I have touched my toe in several. Simply, I enjoy experiencing new areas. This stretch of beach had several high chair units for lifeguards (none during this time of year). In addition, of course, there is the Newport Beach Pier. Balboa has that charm of old, being a small beach community. There are several condominiums for rent along this stretch of beach, which I imagine enjoy some fabulous sunsets facing west to the Pacific. A bit pricey though could be worth it.\nOur second day in Balboa concentrated on the island. We took a ferry over, enjoyed a lunch, and walked the circumference. The ferry costs only $1, holds a few cars and passengers, and comes often. Another evening, we returned to see the Christmas lights. Being December, again, there were no crowds, except the locals. This community pulls all the plugs for their decorations. There may be a competition for all the displays, for all I know. It was well worth the second trip over to the island.\nAccording to my friend, summer is an entirely different story \u2013 LOTS of people. I think I prefer December.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed March 10, 2017", 4.0, "FUN LITTLE ISLAND..good to explore.", "WITH DOG IN TOW, We walked the beautiful Balboa Island, admiring some extravagant bayside homes.
