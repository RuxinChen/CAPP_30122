It is a beautiful area with many activities to choose from. It can get pricey with admission fees to the varying museums, etc, so check prices before you go! Also check the hours, as the botanical building is closed on Thursdays.\n\nWe enjoyed the musicians playing in the park, as it certainly added to the ambiance. We could have done without the nitwits blaring junk music on their stereos, though!\n\nWe did find it odd that in some areas, cars were allowed. For example between the Museum of Man and their special exhibit building. There is no clear marking that this area is a \u201cstreet\u201d. The cobblestones are the same color across the entire way. Guests may be preoccupied with looking around the courtyard and at the tower....and not actively looking for cars while crossing. There are two pedestrian crosswalks near this museum...but they are far off to the sides between the museum and the special exhibit (far away from where people naturally cross from one side to the other), which made zero sense! In another area of the park, we saw a car come to a screeching halt and nearly hit a pedestrian walking with a cane. The man was clearly in a crosswalk but the car driver obviously wasn\u2019t paying attention. Luckily the pedestrian was ok. So BE CAREFUL when walking around this park...you can\u2019t assume that cars are prohibited throughout the entire campus.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 11, 2018", 5.0, "One of Caifornia\u2019s Best", "Balboa Park in San Diego should be a must visit when in San Diego.
