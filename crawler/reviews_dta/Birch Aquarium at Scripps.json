When I heard about Birch, which is an extension of Scripps Institute of Oceanography, I had to go when I was recently in the San Diego area. At first surprised at the aquarium's small size, I quickly became fascinated with the nicely designed exhibits, from a giant kelp forest to tide pools. But my favorite, which I could barely tear myself away from, focused on seahorses.\n\nAt least a dozen species swim in tanks here. Their coloring ranges from bright yellow to electric blue. My nose almost pressed against the glass as I watched each propel through the water with a small fluttering fin. The piece de resistance, however, proved to be a short film about mating and birth. That's because the male bears the unborn young. The female deposits her eggs into the male's pouch, where he fertilizes them internally. I could almost see relief on the male's face after labor and strong contractions led to a host of newborns bursting from his pouch.\n\nA large global warming exhibit also beckoned with its graphs and other scientific indicators. It provided educational moments for many families as parents explained to their children what the information meant. I also especially liked a small marine photography exhibition with exceptional works. The highlight for me was a photograph of a Munk's Devil Ray jumping many feet out of the water during its courtship ritual.\n\nThe aquarium has an outside concession stand -- Splash Cafe -- where drinks and light fare are sold. There are tables with shade umbrellas where people can sit but purchases can also be taken into the aquarium.\n\nA large parking lot offers free parking for up to three hours, which is more than enough time to see the aquarium.
