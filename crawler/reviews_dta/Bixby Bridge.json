Want to know a secret? I don't think you need to drive the whole thing to get a good feel for this iconic roadway.\n\nMy favorite parts of this famous highway are:\n1. Santa Monica to a bit north of Malibu\n2. Carmel to Bixby Bridge\n\nSince I'm talking about Bixby Bridge, I'll just focus on some tips regarding the second choice.\n\nI did a bunch of short trips from Carmel and Monterey down the PCH-1 to Bixby. This is a great spot to take out of town visitors if they want to get a taste of the PCH-1 drive without having to commit to the long drive down to San Simeon. At the moment, I don't think you can go TOO far past Bixby anyway due to the situation with one of the other bridges.\n\nIf your time in California is short, you can drive from Carmel to Bixby in a mere 15-30 minutes (depending on traffic). The rugged coastline is jaw dropping! I recommend continuing on for another 10-20 minutes south just to take in more of the gorgeous views. I promise, you will have a TON of photo ops along the way!\n\nTraffic does move slowly at times on this road as it's very curvy and there are a lot of tourists driving slowly along the road. There are many pull offs along the side of the road where you can stop to take photos, as always be cautious when crossing the road and look both ways since you do have a lot of dazed tourists driving around while gawking at the views.\n\nI've done the PCH-1 drive from Hearst Castle to Carmel twice, which is south to north. The views are probably a bit more impressive going in the other direction, but you will also be on the side with the drop off.\n\nThe highway suffered some damage this past winter due to storms. One of the bridges further down is currently being rebuilt, so you can't currently do the popular Carmel to Hearst Castle drive, you would have to take an alternate route.\n\nThe other thing to consider when timing your trip to Bixby is the marine layer, this is basically a fog that seems to often burn off by noon most days. If you are opting to head out first thing in the morning to take photos by the bridge, it may not be clear and sunny yet. Ask about this at your hotel if you prefer to go when it's less foggy, they can probably give you a better idea on timing. Time of year also plays into this, so I recommend doing more research to find out the ideal time to do visit if this is your main purpose of coming to CA.\n\nCell phone reception is not the greatest down by Bixby, but that depends on your carrier too. Also, be sure to get gas before heading down the PCH-1 as there aren't a ton of businesses.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 4, 2017", 5.0, "Grab your camera!", "As we crossed the bridge, we realised this is a truly stunning view and even my partner said to me 'grab your camera'.
