Best time of the day to see the falls is late afternoon when the sun is shining on it. Parking was tough, but not to impossible.

But up-close there are actually too many trees in the way so you can't even see the falls (unlike Yosemite Falls where the trail offers you amazing views walking up to it). The only way you could see the falls would be to get to the top of the trail past all the trees, and in early springtime the water is so massive and thick and the spray is so huge that we got soaked and couldn't see a thing through all the spray. If I recall, in summer the water dies down low enough that you can get to the top of the trail without having your eyes blasted by the water.
