My wife and I looked at each other, grinned, and plunged right in because there was neither a line to get in, nor was there an entrance fee to pay. Wow, what a marvelous experience! Our visit of about 90 minutes included meandering through the various galleries with historical pictures and accounts of the design and growth of the cable car system in San Francisco since its inception. But the highlight for me was seeing the confluence of all the cables that run under the streets finally converging in this single location. The powerful wheels spinning with the cables were an amazing sight. It was an awe inspiring experience to watch the cables zipping by knowing that they were flowing under the concrete streets to points miles away. San Francisco is an expensive city to visit; it has lots to see and do, and this is one attraction that positively adds to the value factor.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 29, 2017", 5.0, "A Great Stop for 1/2 Hour or So", "In addition to interesting historical exhibits and displays, this place contains the main workings (huge pulleys, wheels, motors, workshops, etc.) for the cable car lines.
