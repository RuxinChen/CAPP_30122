But make sure you take a map with you. Because the staff working on the cable cars are extremely rude. They don't tell you what stops are next. Nor do they answer any questions. They hate their jobs and are not afraid of showing it. To the point that my sister attempted to take a selfie on the cable car and the man driving the cable car pushed her arm. That was rude. She's a tourist and excited to be on such an amazing transportation obviously she's going to take a photograph.\n\nWhile in San Fran ride the cable cars but know that the two guys operating the car will be rude, not tell you what's the next stop, roll there eyes at you, and curse at individuals that don't speak English.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 23, 2018", 4.0, "Get a day pass at least!", "One way fare is $7 which you can pay as you get on the car, or at lots of places around town you can buy a day pass or 3-day pass or 7-day pass.
