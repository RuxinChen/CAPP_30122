There\u2019s also an assistant keepers quarters, which now displays lighthouse artifacts. You can walk over to the west where there\u2019s interpretive signs about the kelp forest off the coast and the whales and wildlife which are frequently seen passing by. You can take another road down by the water where you can park and explore tidepools in the Rocky Intertidal Zone of the ocean side of the peninsula. We got here late in the day and didn\u2019t have much time before they herded us out, but this was a fun place to explore and look for critters. I liked the place a lot, but wasn\u2019t thrilled about honoring Cabrillo, an early Spanish explorer and conqueror. He was exploring north from what would become Mexico about 50 years after Christopher Columbus, and he also commanded three ships.
