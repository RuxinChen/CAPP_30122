Not the hollywood actors, I mean the night sky.\n\nOur twin 10 year olds and our 4 year old were in awe (as we were) of not only the night sky, but the town at night.

Thanks to the vision of Walter Knott, best known for Knott's Berry Farm, the remnants were rescued and those buildings beyond repair were reconstructed. He used aerial surveys to find the outlines of the foundations, and historic photos.\n\nMr. Knott gave the town to the County of San Bernardino in 1966 and it is operated as a county regional park.

The bunkhouse, amazingly enough, not only has bunk beds, but also heating and air conditioning!\n\nCalico is a mix of open air history museum and shops. The shops are in the restored buildings, and tend to have their own themes, for example, one shop spotlights candy, while another offers something for your favorite dog (or cat -- think \"cat sup\" in a bottle that you put on kitty's kibble to encourage it to eat....).\n\nIn addition to the fee to enter the park,you can pay $3 to walk through the \"Maggie Mine\" and get an idea of what it must have been like to work in one (albeit without the noise and dust that must have been created) and $4 to ride the little train that goes around a short route with commentary about the surrounding hills and mines.\n\nThe school house has been reconstructed and sits prominently at the highest point of the town. From its porch you have a great view of the surrounding dessert, and the dry lake bed below. Unfortunately, the school house was not open the day we visited in November, but you can look in the windows to see the old stove in the center and the rows of desks, arranged by size (little ones to one side, older/bigger kids on the other).\n\nSome tips:\n\nWear sturdy walking shoes.\nWhile the board walks are likely wheelchair accessible, most of the shops are not, AND the Main Street is quite steep if you are pushing a heavy chair.\nThe rest rooms we used were not accessible, but I spotted another set of restrooms closer to the entry that might be - if you are bringing someone who is mobility impaired, it would be worth checking on this!\nIf you are going into the mine, bring a small flashlight - there are lights inside, but some stretches are dark and the floor is uneven. (The little shop sells flashlights as well.)\nThere is a restaurant in the park with a large dining room and also a back porch for seating.\nCalico can be very windy - prepare for dust if you wear contacts! And wear a hat that ties on, or you will find yourself chasing it up the street.\n\nWhile there does not seem to be a docent tour, the shop owners are all very happy to tell you the history of the town, and especially of the structure in which the shop is located, and staff members in the park office are also willing to share their knowledge. The leaflet you are a given when you pay admission gives you a lot of information about the town's history and includes a map and a list of the original buildings.\n\nSo come and get an idea of what it was like to live and work in this high desert town (and buy a couple of souvenirs to help support the concessionaires).\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 2, 2017", 3.0, "Not as last visit", "This open air museum tries to show how these kinds of short time mining towns looked liked and functioned, which they success to some extent.

A friend of mine suggested we try again today, and I'm glad we decided to go. We arrived at the park at around 9 a.m., or a little after. After looking at the admission prices, it turned out to be cheaper to purchase an annual pass for $50 than to pay the individual admission prices (I think it's $8 for 12 and up, and $5 for 11 and under, but I may be incorrect there). The only issue I have with the season pass is that it is only good for a family of four, and we are a family of 6, so that means we'll still have to pay regular admission prices for two people on any return trips.\nThis time around, there was virtually no one at the park. No crowds, no long staircase climb from the lower parking lot. Fantastic! We were able to wander from building to building and actually go in all of the stores without feeling crowded. I think R&D Fossil and Rock shop is probably my favorite store in the park. They have some really neat rock specimens for those who like those kinds of things. I did notice that most of the shops and buildings are dog friendly, so it's possible to bring your dog along. I should also note that in the high desert it gets brutally hot in the summer months. Make sure you wear appropriate sun attire, sunscreen, etc. Bring water, and if you decide to bring your dog, keep in mind that the pavement here gets extremely hot and can burn your pet's paws.\n\nBecause the park was not overcrowded on this trip, we were able to eat at the main restaurant in the park for lunch. When we came in, there were few other patrons and we were able to pick where we wanted to sit. Our server was quick and attentive. Food here consists of typical burger-type staples, some BBQ, and a few fish items. All of the kids in our party seemed satisfied with their meals. Drinks here are served in HUGE quart-sized mason jars. Overall the food and service were good, and it was great to be able to eat inside out of the heat of the day.

Camping options include cabins, large bunkhouses, OHV area sites, full service sites, electric only, and a fair number of unserviced / tent spots. Over 230 spots in total by my count. Central washrooms & showers round out the support services.\n\nThere is a double duty off-road vehicle area that both meets the needs of the gas-powered rock jockeys and also to agitate those folks who are searching for desert peace & quiet. This area is located at the park entrance so is a good distance from the quieter folks so no noise or dust issues were noted during our stay.\n\nThe Ghost Town is located up the hill from the campgrounds so is a good warmup for your walking adventure.\n\nThere are 31 main structures and 5 of these are historical Calico mining town buildings. The town offers almost every option imaginable ranging from Boot & Saddle Repair to wood carvings. I\u2019m also happy to add that there are also 3 vendors of cold beer which are strategically spread among the other fascinating businesses. Needless to say, I set my walking pace to correspond with the spacing of these beverage sources but only to ensure that I did not become dehydrated from the dry desert air. Safety first is my primary motto while cold beer is a strong second.\n\nThe shops are all old-timer with some housed in original buildings. Lots of tourist trap silliness as would be expected as well as some cranky folks who really don't want to be working there. Amongst the normal highway sideshow trappings are some excellent bits of work by local artists as well as some characters who add color to the town theme, and even some excellent service people who clearly have found a job they enjoy and don't mind spreading that sunshine with their customers.\n\nIn addition to the gift shops, there are a number of food vendors that were surprisingly average. Not sure why we expected anything different but the unique location seemed to demand unique food experiences.\n\nSome excellent mini-museums that displayed the early and developing days of Calico, the arts and sciences involved in mining the various minerals in the area, and examples of homelike in an 1880 mining community.\n\nWe visited mid-week to avoid busy weekend crowds but there was a surprising number of foreign and domestic visitors that made the Main Street quite lively.\n\nWe didn't get a chance to check out the tiny railroad because it was exceptionally windy during our visit and the train was shut down. A little while later, the entire town was closed down due to the danger of flying shingles, garbage containers, and small children.\n\nPrices are high but as expected in this out of the way place.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed March 26, 2017", 5.0, "Great way to spend a couple hours", "We were staying in Barstow a few days and decided to wander just down the road from our KOA and visit Calico Ghost Town.

We were directed to a lower parking lot, but after that it was a free-for-all trying to find a space to park in the canyon. There are stairs to access the main street area, but be prepared to walk up about five to six flights of uneven stairs with handrails constructed from 2x4's. There is also a shuttle bus that goes to the upper parking area, which we elected not to wait for. The main street is set up as an old west mining town, which my children thought was really neat to see. There are only two buildings that are actually original to the town. The rest were constructed on site specifically for tourists. There were no outside food stands or anywhere available to purchase food on the go. There options were the sit-down restaurant, and a slapdash pizza shack tucked in an alleyway between two buildings. Both were overcrowded. There was a live band playing in the area of the pizza place that made hearing what was being said nearly impossible. There were several costumed role-players wandering about, which coincidentally makes it impossible to tell who works there and who just dressed up, and we did get to see a shooting show with actors in the street. One of my children was scared by the shooting noise, so keep that in mind for smaller children. There is only one \"ride\", and that is the train ride that is basically a slow 15-minute ride that gives some brief history about the mining and the town.

I have no idea if that last part is truthful, but it doesn't make any difference who banned the items. What that means is that you will be left with no proof that there is or is not activity in these locations, unless you just happen to see an apparition of some kind. So here is the breakdown:\nMaggie Mine Tour: This tour starts right after the park closes so it is still light. It begins at the bottom of the hill where you park and if you leave and come back you will not have to pay the $8 to park a second time. You can tour the Maggie Mine during the day for $3, it's worth it. Not a long mine to walk through but it is underground and has been secured from cave ins. Kids would love it. The after hours tour is conducted with a guide or two (we had two) and with lights and ventilation turned off. You are given flashlights, the little generic ones that a cast a beam about twenty feet. They don't restrict you bringing your own, but you will have to carry it. I used a Coast 370 Lumins with a belt clip for easy carry. I also carried our usual IR equipped camcorder with a IR assist without the guides trying to pick on it as being \"equipment\" In fact one guide asked me what it was so I don't think they had ever seen IR in use before. As can be guessed, without equipment we had no captures, but I would recommend this tour, as $10 for an hour or more underground can't be beat. The guides told their personal stories which were good and you could tell that they had personally experienced them, which is a big plus. As far as a mere tour I recommend this tour.\nThe Schoolhouse tour: The schoolhouse is closed to human traffic during park hours the only way to see the inside is through signing up for the after hours ghost tour. Check for age limitations when you book. Again, this is a $10 tour as of the time of this writing. It begins after the Maggie Mine tour so as not to conflict with timing. It starts at the entrance to town and you are walked by flashlight up main street. The park is closed, you are the only ones in it at this time of night. Stay with your guide and use your flashlights. There are rattlesnakes in the desert area at night and they are not beyond coming onto the path although we were blessed and did not run across any. You will be walked up to the schoolhouse where the guides will give a short historical speech and then let you in and you will sit in one of the little kids chairs from the period. The only light in the schoolhouse is the one the guide has. IR, if you have it, will be desired. We were here in August, the schoolhouse is hot and luckily we sat near one of the open windows for a breeze. The stories that we were told about sightings were not first hand experiences which was a disappointment to us. This leads us to believe that perceived activity here is few and far between if it does exist at all. Again, no equipment allowed here. You will be in the schoolhouse for about half an hour or a little more as they pass out what they believe would be \"trigger objects\" of the period, but that brought out nothing. This tour was interesting, just to say that we had done it, but probably would not go back on this one again. Our videos of these tours have been posted.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 28, 2016", 3.0, "Tourist trap!", "We had high hopes for this place but to be honest there are about three buildings that are actually original.

Walter Knott has a connection because his uncle John C. King co-owned the Silver King Mine with a friend...walter spent a lot of time at Calico as a young boy. He ended up buying the land much later and rebuilt some of the burned down buildings using aerial maps images of the foundations. At the same time, he removed some buildings and many artifacts from the town and transported them to the now famous, Knott's Berry Farm. He donated the town of Calico to the County of San Bernardino where it remains a Regional Park. Calico is also registered as a California Historical Landmark (Landmark #782) and in 2005, was proclaimed by then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to be California's Silver Rush Ghost Town.\n\nVisitors that don't take the time to learn about the people who lived there and the history of Calico, always describe the town as \"touristy\"... back in Calico's 1880s heyday, its residents all has businesses that lined the single street town...they were all there to make money in order survive...especially in that harsh environment....well the same thing applies to the modern business occupants...they are all individually owned, some merchants own more than one business...but the fact remains, they are trying to survive much like the original townsfolk who's blood, sweat, and tears, are now dust on the wind....\n\nAnyway...Calico is an interesting place to visit.

There is Dorsey's Doghouse on site where you can pick up booties to protect them...but be prepared ahead of time....water is available.\n\nCome to Calico with the mindset that you are actually walking on the same land where hundreds of miners, families, and businessmen once tread as well.

Calico House Restaurant is worth a visit as it is the oldest surviving building in town, built in the 1880's. A good selection of bbq items, burgers, salads, and desserts. Patio dining out back is pet friendly with a nice view of the townsite. For travelers looking for a desert experience, there is a nearby campground and OHV area.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 20, 2016", 4.0, "Interesting and worth a visit", "As you would expect, Calico Ghost Town is quite remote and a decent drive for most visitors. However, worth the effort! I would describe it as an interactive living museum. There is something for everyone, as there are original buildings, informative facts and stories to read, shops selling smellies and candles, a working saloon bar and photo opportunities. For young children you can actually enter an old mine and see the conditions the miners worked under and a working mine train for a ride. They won't become bored and disrupt your visit if promised the mine or train ride.....or the usual ice-cream!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 20, 2016", 5.0, "Hidden Gem", "Calico Ghost Town was our first stop on our CA-VA cross country road trip and well worth a visit. I doubted stopping here and was really only expecting to walk around for a few minutes. Our visit ended up being about 3 hours. There is much to see from quirky souvenirs to original gifts, to educational museums/walkthroughs. While it was hot during the day, you can get plenty of shade heading inside the little stores. We did not get on the train; however, we did pay to walk in the mine and walk through the mystery house which was very cool and worth the inexpensive price.\n\nWe were on a time crunch in getting to our next stop so we had to eventually leave without discovering the entire town. Regardless, this place is highly recommended. Travelled with an 8 and 13 year old daughter who also enjoyed it.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 19, 2016", 1.0, "Waste of Time", "As part of my drive from LA to Vegas I read about this ghost town and thought it was worth a quick visit. I thought that it was a real Ghost town that I could wander around, but they wanted to charge $10.00 to just wander around. I asked the front lady what was there to see to as I only wanted to spend an hour tops, she was quite rude. She wouldn't even share a map that showed me what was. I asked if the burnings are still 100% original and in their original spots to make it authentic. She couldn't tell me so I left. If you are traveling through here, stay cool and keep driving.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 15, 2016", 3.0, "Nice for short break if you are driving nearby.", "Nice for a walk around and stretch your legs while driving from/to Vegas.

Didn't ride the train, but went inside the mine, which was very cool, both literally and figuratively."], ["Reviewed July 11, 2016", 4.0, "Had a weird experience in the Maggies Mining.", "My husband and I were coming from our Vegas trip and saw the signs on the road and decided to give it a try! It was 106 degrees. We were lucky because it wasn' t crowded eventhough it was a Saturday. But not too many personel working so didn't really get the whole experience! The stores were all full of history! One of the stores (post office) which sold refreshments and bought some drinks , I asked the cashier if this place was haunted? And got no answer? Little did I know obviously it was and to my surprise got a picture of one in the Maggies Mining! I felt weird and uncomfortable at some point and took a picture!
