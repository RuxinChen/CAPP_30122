Of course in San Francisco there are many museums like Walt Disney Family Museum, Asian Art Museum, San Francisco Museum of Modern art, Musee Mecanique, Cable car Museum etc. But as most children in our batch were interested in watching various types of plants, fishes and animals, we chose this place which is a must see for everyone. It requires almost one whole day to see so many rare and astonishing things here that we have not seen elsewhere. The academy people deserve our utmost compliments and appreciation for their untiring efforts in preserving all these specimens and in promoting the spirit of science and in creating awareness of caring for our environment and other fellow creatures and beings which have their right to live and grow in their habitats. For this purpose the Academy provided suitable surroundings and simulated conditions for all these creatures to survive without any discomfort and troubles. This Academy is located at Music Concourse Drive on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, in the heart of the city. This institution started as a society in 1853. In 2008 it was designed by the famous Italian architect, Renzo Piano and re-built in a spacious area. It was opened for public on 27th September, 2008.\n\nThe building was constructed in eco-friendly style having a spacious area of four lakh square feet. Nearly 26 million specimens are preserved and looked after here by the managing committee consisting of forty one trustees who allocate duties to executive members. This academy is a scientific and educational institution \u201cdedicated to exploring, explaining and sustain life on earth.\u201dApart from display of exhibits this academy arranges lectures, workshops, field trips and demo classes on bio-diversity, taxonomy, anthropology, marine biology, herpetology, ichthyology and phylogenetics.\nKimhall Natural History Museum has three sections; The Osher Rain Forest, Aquarium and Africa Hall (the oldest running exhibit). The Rain Forest section is housed under a 90 foot glass dome kept at 82-85 Fahrenheit temperature with 75% of humidity in air to suit the rain forest flora and fauna. Various trees and plants from Borneo, Madagascar and Costa Rica are seen on three floors as we climb the stairs enclosed on both sides by glass covering. Huge palms, mahogany trees, orchids and others with dark green leaves take us into the world of nature filled with so many different kinds of plants and flowers. Colorful butterflies, moths and birds are seen flitting all around. Under the first floor the Amazonian forest is displayed with flooding waters. One can also see various types of reptiles and amphibians kept in glass cases. Nearly 1600 live animals are displayed here and one is surprised to see so many different kinds of snakes and frogs. In Steinhart Aquarium various types of fishes, corals, crabs, sea anemones, urchins, stingrays, star fish, and snails are displayed. The aquarium is the star attraction of this place. Many children love to see the bright colored fish and multicolored corals and urchins.\n\nThe Tusher African Hall is another place of attraction to see lifelike models of various jungle animals displayed in glass cases. At the entrance \u201cHuman odyssey\u201d the evolution of man is shown by display of various human fossils and skulls. The computer animation of the famous Lucy skeleton shows how changes occurred in physical structure of human species in course of time. The models of African animals like the tiger, the lion, the rhino, the elephant and the antelope are quite realistic and impressive. At one of the hall within a glass enclosure are kept the African penguins which dip and dive in the 25,000 liter water tank. In the East Wing one can see Foucault pendulum, a huge 16-ich diameter brass ball weighing about 238 pounds hung from the ceiling by an aircraft control wire. It demonstrates the earth\u2019s rotating movement on its axis. In the West Wing many geophysical exhibits are shown in various glass cases. There are nearly four hundred types of various mineral rocks and gems in this section.\n\nIn the Earthquake section a lot of information is given about the occurrence of earthquakes with details photos and models. The effect of earthquake is practically experienced in the chamber by technological simulation. As we had to hurry to get into the planetarium we did not spend much time there to know about earthquakes. The Morrison Planetarium is one of the largest completely digital planetariums with a spacious dome above measuring about ninety feet in diameter and with a seventy five feet broad screen. The introducer gave a lecture about the theme of earth\u2019s evolution and galaxies with their enormous size and numbers. The appearance and features of Pluto were clearly projected on the screen. But we felt it would be better to give more visual details instead of verbal explanation. Details may be shown on the screen itself. At the Naturalist Center many books, toys, specimens, printed T-shirts, films and interactive games are available. In the main hall skeleton of a blue whale is displayed while in another hall the huge skeleton of Tyrannosaurus Rex is seen. At another place the huge skeleton of 87-foot long blue whale is seen suspended from the roof.\n\nAt the Science Project one can look at the scientists working on real, live research projects and also at several smaller exhibits. But most of the scientific research work is carried out in private labs. This institution publishes a journal called \u201cProceedings od the California Academy of Sciences\u201d to inform people about their latest discoveries and information. In 2011 scientists of this institution went on an expedition to Phillipines and discovered nearly three hundred species quite unknown to science.\nThis Museum is open from 9.30 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. from Monday to Saturday and from 11.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. on Sundays. At present the Rain Forest section has been closed from 5th September to 12th October as renovation works are going on. The entry ticket for adults is 35.75 dollars, 30.95 for senior citizens and for those aged between 12 and 17 years and 25.95 dollars for children below twelve years. The authorities may consider reducing the entry fee to facilitate more people coming to this museum and get enough knowledge and awareness in protection of the surroundings and our fellow creatures as well.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 24, 2017", 5.0, "Great Museum", "This was one of the best Natural Science Museums we have been to.

We were there during the Summer of Love exhibit at the de Young museum and that was a lot of fun. We didn't leave enough time to see all of the de Young and the CA Academy of Sciences, which was unfortunate. What we did get to see was well worth the trip.

The first was an improvement, the last one a disaster. When I was a kid it was free, mysterious and awesome. The first renovation added a new greeting hall in the front and you were greeted by a big Allosaurus skeleton. It had many Great Halls. The Hall of Minerals, North American Hall, Steinhart Aquarium, Simson African Hall, Science Hall, Morrison Planetarium, The Hall of Man and more. It was deeply involved in education and it's darkly lit halls let the treasures shine all the more brightly. I'm sure it was responsible for turning many a fascinated child into todays scientists.\n\nThen the mistake. In 2008 the new \"Academy\" opened. Gone were the Great Halls, gone were all the reptiles surrounding the alligators and crocodiles, gone were the fantastic dioramas painted and sculpted by the finest artists, gone was the playful genius of Gary Larson's \"The Far Side\" twisted view of science. And gone was the inspiration of the youth.\n\nInstead, they hired an architect who's sole desire, it would seem, was to show off his building and forget about the fantastic wonders that should have been inside. They boast about the \"Living Roof\"! Who needs a living roof when you are surrounded by Golden Gate Park?!\n\nNow when you pay your outrageous $36 entry, you are greeted not by a dinosaur, but a big restaurant! One of three! Serving regretful food at regretful prices. Food is not why you go to a museum.\n\nIt boast a huge \"Open Space\" with lots of air empty of exhibits apart from printed info panels. Even the great whale skeleton is hung so high that it cannot be fully appreciated.\n\nThe Aquarium might have an enormous tank, but the intimacy and fascination are missing. The Planetarium may be state of the art, but what they gained in digital CG they lost when they threw out the Zeiss star projector.\n\nI'm very sad believing that my beloved Academy will no longer inspirer young, would be, scientists as in did in my youth. Two thumbs down. My whole family were members for three generations, I even worked summers there. I will not go back. It has become a money making travesty, not the awe inspiring institute is once was.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 19, 2017", 5.0, "Great value ! Free with the Citypass", "California Academy of science was A wonderful experience I would highly recommend this for anyone, but families traveling with any age children this is a must. There is a planetarium with numerous shows each day. There are many hands on exhibits, a beautiful aquarium with coral reefs from around the world in the Steiner aquarium on site, hands on an inner active learning areas with live snakes and penguins. This is located in the absolutely beautiful Golden Gate Park area which is an entire days adventure all by itself.\nShow less"]]}}
