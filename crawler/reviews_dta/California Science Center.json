We were on a time limit (about 3 hours) and spent most of that time in the Endeavor exhibit, but we were able to wander around a little afterwards and see some of the other exhibits. We have been to a fair share of science museums; this one was easily the best. The Endeavor exhibit is an extra (nominal) charge--I think we paid $14 for 7 people, but it was completely and utterly fascinating. Not only do they have the shuttle itself on display (that you can completely walk around), but they also have the last remaining External Tank ON EARTH displayed as well! Additional items on display include used Michelin shuttle tires (front and back), a SpaceHab expanded living habitat used in later Shuttle missions, a complete Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), Shuttle Galley (\"space kitchen\" for preparing meals), a fuel cell power plant (for generating electricity, heat and water), Waste Collection System (\"Shuttle Potty\"), TONS of pictures, the purchase order for the shuttle, \"Mission 26: The Big Endeavor,\" an amazing video showing how they transported Endeavor 12 miles from LAX through neighborhoods and other tight spaces (sometimes with only inches of clearance on either side of the shuttle's wings), and lots more.\n\nAdmission to the California Science Center is free (parking is not), but a ticket to see Endeavor is in the $2-$3 range per-person. Note that the University of Southern California (USC) is CaliSci's next-door neighbor, and their sporting stadium is built RIGHT NEXT to the Science Center (like mere feet away). We attended on a \"home\" football game day and found traffic to be an absolute NIGHTMARE. Parking was expensive, parking spaces were very difficult to find, traffic was nearly gridlocked, and there were MOBS of people EVERYWHERE. While we tried very hard not to let these things ruin our day, it definitely made getting there and getting home again VERY difficult. I highly recommend checking USC game and event schedules to make sure there are no major sporting events happening on the day you want to attend...and if there are, think VERY hard on whether or not you want to deal with that mess.\n\nOther fascinating exhibits on display deal with space and aviation, ecosystems, science gadgets to play with, as well as much, much more. A new \"King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh\" exhibit opens in March, 2018. An IMAX theater, a \"Body Worlds\" (human bodies in various stages of dissection) and other attractions are available for additional cost as well. There are dining options if you get hungry, and at least 2 gift shops that we saw (one devoted exclusively to Space Shuttle Endeavor). Handicapped people should have no difficulty navigating the massive buildings, as everything is completely handicap-friendly.\n\nPeople of all ages will find a day at CaliSci to be utterly entertaining and enjoyable. You will be amazed how fast the time flies! I can't recommend this attraction enough and loved the reminder of just how FUN learning can be!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 24, 2018", 4.0, "Endeavor Space Shuttle", "The California Science Museum is the final home for the Endeavor Space Shuttle.
