The building itself is beautiful and meticulously maintained. There are some art tiles installed outside one of the entrances that shouldn't be missed.\n\nWhen entering, expect to pass through a metal detector and have your bag(s) searched, as this is a working government office. Once inside, there are a lot of areas to explore. Each of California's counties is represented by a diorama, and they line the hallways for you to check out. There are a few impressive sculptures to admire, and many paintings throughout the building. There are former government offices that have been preserved for viewing (behind a velvet rope), which are really fun to look at.\n\nWe took a great tour with a friendly, enthusiastic guide. On the tour, we were able to sit in on actual state government sessions, which was fascinating. There is also a great, small gift shop which features books and the other typical museum stuff, as well as handmade art created by local artisans with disabilities.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with the beauty and history of the capitol.

We missed the guided tour - they begin on the hour, so if you want to hit it, plan accordingly. Our little people couldn't hang tight for 30 minutes, and by the time we had showed ourselves around, it didn't seem worth spending more time in the building. I was surprised by the smallness of the capitol, and the run-down appearance of the portion I assume was built in the 70's. The map we were given was terribly produced: black and white, poor layout, looked like it was made on an old hand-crank ditto machine and designed in some ancient computer program, and was not helpful. I looked all over for the \"museum\" and concluded after walking the whole building that the building itself must be the museum. If so, it was a terrible museum in every way. Was quite disappointed that so few of the offices, while one was able to see inside, were not in use of any kind and only re-created to look like what they once did. No info/signage/history posted on those few, re-created rooms. I compare all this to our home state where one can walk in the governors office which IS in use AS the governor's office and beautifully kept in it's historic form. Also, compared to our home state, I was shocked at the lack of art of any kind, including murals and sculptures depicting state history. Not being from CA, the county displays were not of interest but I noted many seemed dated. We saw the Senate chamber, which was lovely and grand, but over-all, I expected more of the building to be like it - lovely, grand, currently used, and it was not. We watched a film in the basement about the preservation. It was quite dated as well - info was good, but pacing and graphics reflected its age. Overall, I was very glad we went for the opportunity to compare and contrast.
