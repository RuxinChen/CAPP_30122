There is great places to stop and take pictures of the seals and ocean. There are bars and breweries as well as bakeries, pizzerias, candy shops, coffee shops, and shopping.

And as sometimes happens it can get pricey. Most of the resturants on the main street are just average and not a great value but it is fun to stop in to one and have a drink while looking out to the ocean. There is a Gharidili chocolate shop with a soda fountain which is fun to visit and alot of touristy shops with trinkets that can probably be skipped.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 12, 2017", 3.0, "Revamped buildings", "The area had been revamped but unfortunately with lots of low end shops (with some notable exceptions). Overheard some young girls saying \"why is there so much sugar?\" and that about summed things up. The aquarium is the obvious centre piece and I'm sure that it's excellent but it wasn't what we were interested in that day so we gave it a miss. Would visit on another occasion when we are geared up for it. Interesting to see what has been made of a run down though historical area. It's just a shame that the shops are so unappealing.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 11, 2017", 4.0, "Fun shopping", "I know this is a touristy area, but I liked it.
