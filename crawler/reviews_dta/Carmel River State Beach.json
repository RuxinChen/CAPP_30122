Very dog friendly - fun to just sit in the sand and watch incredible variety of dogs walking by!"], ["Reviewed May 25, 2017", 5.0, "A Human's and Dog's Paradise", "You can walk this beach forever. Beautiful fine sands, waves pounding your feet, flat sands rise to hills of soft sand for the children to play in. We walked the beach end to end and enjoyed every minute. My only woe was that I didn't have my dog with me. He would have loved it even more; all the different kinds of doggie friends free to play together. I loved watching them caper around.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 22, 2017", 5.0, "Savor the Memories", "Even though a blustery chilly day....a walk on this beach is among Californias finest...certainly one of norcals top.

The shops are pretty interesting and beautiful but to find a good place to park waa not easy. The road and streets are annoying yo turn or can be confusing so slow down. I like the beach but it's nothing new compare to other beaches. There's a part of the beach that is pet friendly!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 20, 2017", 5.0, "Beach", "One of my favorite beaches to visit! With kids or without. Super nice clean and easy to get to parking is all along the beach its kind of limited you can say that. We always have such a great time. We always stay till the sun sets because it's just so beautiful! Dogs are welcomed as well\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 17, 2017", 5.0, "Breathtaking!", "These 2 beaches are a walk apart. Both are white cresant and about 1 mile long each.

Dog friendly. Great place to surf with a dry suit."], ["Reviewed May 6, 2017", 5.0, "Gorgeous views and plenty of sand", "Parking is scarce, but once you're there and unload your picnic stuff, you're sure to be rewarded. The ocean view, sand and atmosphere cannot be compared to anything else. This is right off of Ocean ave, and the sand starts as soon as you're off the parking lot. You can stay at the top of the hill or make your way down to the waves. Either way, sun, sand and waves galore. Bring your drinks, food, sunblock, shades and hat. You're in for a great day!!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 6, 2017", 5.0, "Really a hidden gem!", "Driving down to this spot you wouldn't think you'll get to a large beach spot like we found. The road leading to it is narrow, residential and hilly. If I wasn't looking at my GPS map, I would have never guessed that it is a beach access. And what a wonderful beach it was. On the left side, the river comes down to join the ocean and it widens a bit as it approaches, making for a nice wading spot; even for kayaking and swimming in the shallow fresh water. The ocean waves and the sand are the best at this end of the bay. The other end of the land - I'm guessing Big Sir- is almost opposite so, the view is fabulous. The sand and waves in the for-front and the green mountains as backdrop! I cannot wait to return; now that I know about this.\nThey don't recommend swimming, and fire is not allowed, so picnic is the best option and of course hiking the beach is the highlight of this trip!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 6, 2017", 4.0, "huge sand area", "This is a beach area that underwent some improvements in a recent years. Parking remains small, but waterline moved farther away. You will need to walk on the sand may be 1/4 mile (or less) before reaching water."], ["Reviewed May 4, 2017", 5.0, "You just want to stand there and look.", "We walked down the hill from our hotel, and were instantly mesmerized. What an incredible view! It was close to sunset, and there were many people in the area, most of them snapping photos. The parking lot and side streets were packed with cars, so we were so happy that we had walked. (Although, going back uphill was not that easy.)\n\nYou can either go on the beach, or there is a wooden walkway on the right side. This leads to a small platform, with some seating. Surprisingly, not that many people were on the platform, so we were not cramped there, and had a gorgeous breathtaking view of the sun sinking into the ocean.\n\nIt's worth going out of your way to see such beauty.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 4, 2017", 4.0, "A great beach!
