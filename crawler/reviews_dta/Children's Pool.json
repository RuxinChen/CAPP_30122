The protection afforded by the sea wall indeed protected against the waves and many, many children learned to swim there.\n\nIn the last decade though, seals have overtaken the area and have chosen to do their pupping on the beach. All CA beaches are open to swimmers/people, thus the beach has become a point of interaction between the seals and people. The mire seals, the more poop in the water and the higher fecal organisms contaminating the water. The more people, the more chance of a negative interaction between a sea mammal and human.\n\nAnd thus the legal battle between beach access (people) and the environmentalists (for the seals). Aggressiveness and bullhorns has sometimes shown the worst side of people.\n\nAnd thus let me get this review back to where it belongs.... to the natural beauty of our incredible coastline, especially at The Children\u2019s Pool. My children and I have actually seen a pod of whales sauntering by this area of the coast and we just love enjoying our beautiful coast.

We had no trouble walking it, but any one with mobility issues or unsteady on their feet will find it very difficult to walk on.\n\nSecond, the walkway often has people standing against the rails looking at the seals and sea lions on the beach and in the water. It can be crowded and you need to pay attention as you walk on it.\n\nThird, the seals and sea lions can smell very bad. When we got down there, the stink was pretty bad!\n\nAnd finally, at high tide, the water crashes against the walkway and pours over it.
