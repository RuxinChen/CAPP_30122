Streets were blocked off for pedestrians only so that was nice. There were tents with vendors and free giveaways but the lines were very long and all in Chinese. It was fun to see the bustle of the crowds. Chinatown is full of kitschy stores with lots of stuff. I didn't like dumplings we had but my husband thought they were average. We visited the Tin How Temple that is tucked away in a side street. It is on the top floor. Very small and not what we expected. We can say we've been there. We left for lunch and a break before heading back to see the New Year Parade that evening. We were very excited about seeing it and had a good viewing spot near the beginning of the parade on Market Street. This was not the best parade we have seen. The timing was off so there were long gaps between floats or participants. There was a lot of repetition in performers, many martial arts, ribbons, and small dragons. Lots of spectators left before the end of the parade. We stayed because we wanted to see the 288 foot dragon. That was fun, with lots of firecrackers. Due to the poor timing of the parade we actually got to see the dragon for quite a while. It kept circling around the street waiting to advance. Perhaps in Chinatown proper it is more exciting to see, but for us it was quite a let down. But, we can say we were there and saw the dragon.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 2 days ago", 3.0, "Worth a visit but parking is an issue", "We went during the new year celbrations so it was very busy.

Although a lot of people compare this Chinatown to other Chinatowns or China itself, we felt this was more importantly a representation of Chinese Americans living in San Francisco. SFO's Chinatown can't be compared to China because the people that live there are not Chinese, they're Chinese American, and therefore the experiences are extremely different. We shouldn't pretend to be experts on cultures that we don't identify with, and should come into these spaces understanding that real people live and work here. Reviews on how this Chinatown failed to be authentic stem from an expectation of Chinatown as an extension of China, whereas Chinatowns were created as places of business as well as by patterns of oppression of Chinese people in America that kept these individuals in a particular space in the city. This in and of itself is a type of authenticity that shouldn't be overlooked.\nP.S.

Prepare yourself for authentic stores selling all manner of things \"Chinese'...produce, traditional medicine, dim-sum, butchers, fish mongers etc. Always crowded, always bustling, always ALIVE!

It's a cavernous old joint that serves a nice variety of traditional dim-sum from little carts that patrol the floor like some kind of wheeled Hong Kong siren...and, unlike many of the Hong Kong variety, these sirens are waitresses who speak English so don't hesitate to ask what's in those bamboo steamers.
