This outlet is fairly large it is all open-air with nice seating & shaded areas for the non shoppers to wait & relax. There are various vendors selling snacks & a decent sized food court, the ladies restroom facilities were a big surprise they are gorgeous.\nWhen we needed a respite from shopping & some sustenance Ruby`s Diner covered our needs perfectly.\nI like everyone have my favourite brands, i do know a bargain when i see one & i know my prices. I also come from australia & at this time our dollar is not strong against the US dollar so you really need to know weather your actually getting a good deal or paying too much. The biggest annoyance with outlets for me even ones in australia are that brands also stock their lastest lines/products with the same prices as you would pay in their flagship stores seriously I just want items that are on sale is`nt that the point! It frustrates me also when these outlet stores are \"packed to the rafters\" with stock that they need to move but offer very very average discounts.\nMy favourite stores at Citidel were Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Coach, Max Azria & Guess.There were many other stores & brands that i shopped in but these were where i spent most of my money & got the best bargains. A lot of these brands can be expensive to purchase at home so i will always check out these stores before say H&M, Gap etc. Im not into sports so outlets for brands like Nike, Asics, Adidas etc are stores I dont even walk into. I also dont follow the \"active-wear\" trend in anyway so im unsure about the discounts on these clothing styles. The outlets selling make-up, perfumes etc i thought were not really offering discounts that they should be in an outlet setting. My advice would be check out on line what stores they offer that you would buy from im a handbag girl so i was well catered for.
