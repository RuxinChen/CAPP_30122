With an extra tall height it has a good view of the City and bay at 20 miles an hour. Its' tall arch allows large ships to pass underneath it (mostly military back in the day). I was always told that it was designed to break into sections and float should it be bombed. This preventing enemy bombers from bottling up ships in the south end of the bay. Has not been put to the test yet.\nChicano Park is under the east end of the bridge, with historical ethnic/political murals on the first supports. I don't imagine many casual tourists go to Coronado, but I would suggest if you are staying downtown, take a cab over the bridge and have them drop you at Ferry Landing. You can use the small beach area, the restauraunts or rent a bike there. You can follow Orange Avenue south-west 1.5 miles to the Historic Hotel Del Coronado (where the movie \"Some Like It Hot\" was filmed). The mile long public beach there is my personal favorite. If you are in for some serious adventure/exercise (22 miles), there is a bike trail you can take from downtown, around the south end of the bay, to fairy landing.

There is no stopping in the middle for a selfie. It is a gorgeous bridge and it bridges downtown to one of my favorite places, Coronado Island.\n\nHope everyone has a chance to visit my city. It's a great city, America's Finest City.\n\n~Kevin\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 17, 2017", 5.0, "Beautiful view", "We were happy to find out that the bridge is free! Such a beautiful view and a lovely sight from a distance too. Love taking the ferry, but this was great."], ["Reviewed October 17, 2017", 5.0, "Great bridge", "Had to travel over this bridge to get to Coronado Island where we were staying. Looks quite scary but gives great views of the Island and San Diego. A great feat of engineering skills."], ["Reviewed October 17, 2017", 5.0, "Bridge of Size!", "Beautiful structure and stands out proudly in the San Diego Bay. Much better viewed from afar as opposed to being on it as cars are on the bridge to get to a destination not to sight-see."], ["Reviewed October 15, 2017", 4.0, "A little scary", "I was wondering what the hoopla was about this bridge. From the shore it's just a bridge. It's not the Golden Gate or Brooklyn bridge. But once you go over it you get it. It's so dang high. Driving an RV over it was just a little scary. I couldn't take my eyes off of the road for fear of falling off while white knuckling it all the way across. The reason why it's so high? Navy ships have to get under it on their way out to sea from Naval Base San Diego.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 14, 2017", 5.0, "Beautiful bridge", "This is a beautiful bridge that offers wonderful panoramic views. I would recommend taking some time to drive across it."]]}}
