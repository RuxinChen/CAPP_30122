Over 130 years old, it's scale is just amazing! Try to get into the hotel to visit the lower level and walk around the exterior. There are shops and restaurants. You can stop, grab a bite and take in the amazing views. Then take a walk on the beach. It wasn't sunning or swimming weather during our visit, but that didn't stop us from walking on the beach, dipping our feet in the water and just taking in the views from the sand. (Be prepared for the juxtaposition of Navy jets flying overhead as there is a Naval base on the island.

Orange Avenue boasts many restaurants with both indoor and outdoor seating as well as shops of all kinds. Allow time for a stop and visit at the historic Hotel Del Coronado, founded in 1888. Visit the gift shop and learn about the resident ghost. Have a drink on the veranda to watch the sun set over the Pacific.
