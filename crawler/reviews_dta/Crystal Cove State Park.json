Located along PCH south of Newport Beach and Costa Mesa along the shore you'll run into the park's many entrances. The four parking lots are in chaparral with numerous walkways and hiking paths among the cacti, sage and tumbleweeds. Most of the paths head towards various sections of the beach cliffs, with several picturesque spots along the way. If you make your way down to the beach like we did, there's a section of nice swimming and surfing beach area, a tide pool section to climb and search for wildlife in the pools, a popular underwater diving spot and if you walk a little further, a small little beach front ghost town.\n\nSomewhere between 20-30 houses along the beach and halfway down the cliffs have been condemned and are now part of the state park. Each looks to be derelict and in various states of decay and are protected from humans by chain link fence. Only the top row of homes at the tops of the cliffs are preserved and appear to be rent-able through the park. The architecture was clearly done for most of the homes in the late 1940's to 1960's era surf town.\n\nThere are a few shops and stores, a visitors center, bathrooms, two restaurants and a bar on site. We managed to grab some margaritas and cold water from the bar as we rested, preparing for the return hike up the sandstone cliffs to our car later that afternoon.\n\nIt's a really cool place to check out. I don't recommend the sandy trails for strollers but there is easier access to the cove via steps. Families with older children five and up won't have any problems.
