Make sure your car is in great shape--you do not want to break down in Death Valley-and take water, ever if you have no intention of leaving your car. Be prepared, it can be hotter than anything you can imagine and it can catch up to you and your car fast.\n\nDante's View is at the top of the Black Mountains and it will take your breath away. All of Death Valley will. You can drive up and park and take photos or a break or you can hike and if you decide to hike make sure you know what you are doing.\n\nIf I were you I would go to the Official Death Valley web site and check weather and closures, flash flood can harsh your entire mellow and if it is close to 120 degrees (considering the heat index) , this is information you will need.\n\nYou can also go at night and the stars will just send you into another world.
