Currently, much of Paradise Pier is closed. That drives even more people to Cars, which frequently had waits of 120+ minutes. That, combined with mediocre food and limited entertainment, make for a park that's worth skipping.

After so many issues, I ended up counceling my 8 year old on how we need to just roll with things out of our control. However, since we paid over $400 for the day for our family, the number of these issues was really frustrating. I expect better from Disney.

This review is being made by three adults who went to the park instead of having kids with us so I know that could make a difference with this particular park. However, that being said, I have been to Disneyworld one time without kids and it is great fun for adults, too! So many things were under construction and they were the things that we would have enjoyed. The roller coaster was shut down as well as the Mickey Mouse Ferris Wheel. Also, there were two other attractions that were temporarily closed during the day. We were surprised to find that we were waiting in lines for 45 min. We did use the fast pass but you have to wait so much time in between each ride to schedule those. I know how crowded these parks get because I have been to Disneyworld three different times. However, this isn\u2019t their busiest time of the year and; truthfully, the park isn\u2019t that large and we really felt they should have had one pass for both parks. Possibly, if there were more rides available, there wouldn\u2019t be these really long waits, We only were able to get on 6 rides/attractions in 6 hrs. and that was using a fast pass for 3 of them.

We did checkout the whole Park but never bothered with any other rides except in Cars Land. The big Micky Mouse wheel was closed which no-one informed us about. It was busy but not as busy as other times of the year I suspect. We had a really long day from 9am-8pm. We bought our tickets the day before when we ventured to Disney Downtown. When we arrived there were queues but they went very quickly. We got fast passes for the Cars Land Racers ride but even with them it worked out that we could only get on the ride twice in the whole day. We covered the other 2 rides as well which were all good. The best is definitely the racers, a real must do.\n\nThe whole set up in Cars Land was amazing you felt like you were really there. The had different characters coming along all day as well. The food was unexpectedly no expensive and fairly good too. On the whole my boys loved it but as they inly wanted to see one area we just did the one day. I believe its much smaller than Disneyland in Florida? There are deals for 2 parks over 2 days look on the website although you can buy your tickets at the entrance for the same price I believe.

Several rides broke down after we'd waited in line for nearly an hour, which was extremely disappointing. However, if you have time, spread out your experience over several days so you don't experience the disappointment of a broken ride. The employees certainly work hard to keep things moving, but some of these things are just beyond their control.

We used the max pass to book fast passes for the two most popular rides - radiator springs and the guardians of the galaxy ride. Since we were travelling with our toddler, we used the rider switch option for both rides. The walkways are wider than Disneyland which aided in less people crammed into small spaces. However, due to the construction of the paradise pier area which will become a Pixar land a couple of months down the road, it felt like at least a quarter of the park was not in use. We enjoyed the shows and rides, but one day is definitely enough for this park.\n\nThe only real negative event that happened was in the morning at the entrance gates. We arrived early and when it was our turn to enter, the parking attendant asked us how many tickets we had to scan. I said two. She glared at us and asked if our daughter was under three. We said yes, she\u2019s 2.5. She then paused for awhile and sternly asked our daughter to stand up. She did and the attendant glared at her some more with a loud pout and glared at us. We then proceeded through the entrance gates. This unfortunate experience soured our entire morning as we were left thinking why this happened. Was it due to racism or the fact that our toddler is a tall girl for her age? Everyone else beside us was getting through the gates fine and we were never asked how old our daughter was otherwise. My husband and I concluded that it was completely fair of the entrance attendant to second guess our daughter\u2019s age as she is indeed big for her age, but she could have simply asked us to show I.D. which would have efficiently solved any issue without making us feel like we were terrible parents trying to fraudulently usher our child through the gates without paying for her.

So we went oCalifornia Adventures for the first time. The food and snacks were quite underwhelming both at the Cocina Cucamonga, and the booths along the Festival Of Holidays street. It was a nice idea in theory to set up booths with different flavors from different cousins around the world, however the execution was not quite there at least for the snacks we tries. We did try several snacks, like the Brussel Sprouts with toppings, and the Chocolate Yule log, and unfortunately they all ended up in the trash after the first bite.\n\nThe rides themselves were ok, the girls got fast passes for a few of them, however it was so inconvenient to walk miles between rides just to get a fast pass. And the most stupid thing of all????you couldn't get a fast pass if you already had one for another ride scheduled.\n\nWell, you park Geniuses, we got one fast pass at 2 which required us to return at 7 PM. This means that you wasted 5 hours of our time in between, because we couldn't get another fast pass. WE WERE PRISONERS OF LINES FOR THOSE 5 HOURS!!!!!!\n\nThen there was the Grizzly boat ride. Again, who are park genius engineers that decided it's a brilliant idea for people to have to stretch their legs and bodies in acrobatic positions in order to get into the wobbly boats while the rotund platform is spinning Non-Stop??? They should be fired. Very unsafe and very inconvenient. The ride itself was ok for the most part, until we got slammed so hard and almost thrown off the boat if it weren't for the seatbelts. I've been in 3 car accidents, where I got hit from behind, and none of that has given me whiplash or the bruises on my back that I got from being slammed back into the hard plastic seats of this ride. The park \"Geniuses\" need to pud padding to minimize the bruising impact of this ride.\n\nNext, we got on Racing Cars ride radiator springs, when the wait time showed 90 minutes. It actually ended up being 2 hours and 20 minutes because they had some type of malfunction and stopped the ride completely. We had been in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes by then, so we decided to wait. Very bad decision, it was a 2 and a half hours of PURE TORTURE listening to the most horrible CAT Screeching Banjo playing folk music or blue grass or whatever it is. Combined with the long line, and the bratty kids screaming and jumping every second like monkeys, this music was punishment of the highest caliber for an amusement park ride line. Couldn;t they at least play some country or even Christmas music like they did in the rest of the park?\n\nThen after over 1 hour at the Mickey Ferris wheel they tried to rush everybody through so we didn't even get our own gondola. The only ride I had been looking forward to, and we got stuck with an Asian Dad and his kids who wouldn't stop yapping for a minute, and keep asking us to take pictures of them. I didn't pay $123 for the Cal Adventure ticket, to play photographer for the asian tourists.\n\nWe will never, ever, ever, visit this park again, or bring any of our guests that visit annually from Europe, Australia, and Eastern USA.

They apparently can\u2019t figure out they they shouldn\u2019t be selling season passes at the regular ticket windows because they have to answer a ton of questions which slows down the line considerably. This was after waiting on another,one to have our bags searched.\n\nWhen we finally were able to enter the park, tickets in hand It was 10 am. I then immediately tried to get some fast passes for the Radiator Springs ride and guess what? They were for 9 pm !! How ridiculous that by 10 am they already sold out of all the daytime fast passes. So therefore, the stand by wait times for the popular rides was ranging from 1-2 hours. What might have help would have been if I purchased the max pass ( extra $10 per ticket) which allows you to access the fast pass tix on iPhone app, so I could have at least reserved the first tix before we left the hotel room. Still, they only let you use it once every two hours.\n\nWe have three young kids, paid several hundred dollars for park tickets and actually only got to go on about 5 rides the entire day. The park was so crowded it was actually difficult to push a double stroller around without constantly bumping into people. It was a joke. God forbid there was an earthquake or fire, people would get trampled.\n\nDisney is clearly very very greedy, charged a 25% premium for tickets that day, let in twice the number of people they should have, they doesn\u2019t give people access to the rides due to capacity constraints .\n\nWe were super super disappointed. Shame on you Disney, we won\u2019t be coming back soon and we will share our experience with all of our friends with kids. FYI we went to LEGO land yesterday and it was leagues more accessible and we had a much better time there.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 7, 2018", 4.0, "Great Trip With the Grandkids", "We took our grandkids to Disneyland the first week of January 2018. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel which was nice but if I had it to do over again I would pay the extra $$ and stay at the Grand Californian to avoid walking through Downtown Disney every day.\n\nLines were quite long but it is what it is. We enjoyed all the rides we went on and the kids had a great time. Spent some time at the hotel pool and the kids loved that too.\n\nAs this was our granddaughters first trip to the parks we tried to line up things that she would enjoy but her older brother enjoyed everything as well.\n\nWe did a character breakfast at Goofy's Diner the first morning and our granddaughter was very excited to see all the characters. The next morning we did the breakfast at Ariels Grotto and she was thrilled to see all the princesses. We had lunch at the Cathay Restaurant, which is a bit higher end and we appreciated the quiet, as part of the Frozen performance and it was great. Show was good and it was worth it to get in and seat ourselves before the throng rushed in.\n\nWe had dinner at the the Trattoria as part of a package to see World of Color which paid off as they have a special area marked out for the diners and the kids had a great view of the show.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 7, 2018", 5.0, "Family visit always fun", "Holiday season. Very busy but the staff was great and the rides fun\nThe new Defenders of the Galaxy was a long line but a fast pass made it worth it.\nSit in the middle of the Soaring ride if you can. No distortion on the video and very relaxing while exciting.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 6, 2018", 5.0, "Better than Disneland for adults and teens", "If you no longer have very young children, if you want to avoid the baby stroller traffic jams and you actually want some gutsy rides, don't waste your time with Disneyland, go next door to California Adventure Park instead. If you have both young and older children, buy a flexible ticket that grants in/out/in /out entry to both on the same day. The Cars area is great, the Guardians of the Galaxy Ride is a cracker, and California Screamin is a very good roller coaster.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 6, 2018", 5.0, "Well staffed for Holidays", "We were concerned about going the Friday of New Year's weekend but the park was well staffed and they handled the crowded park very well.

Never been to this park and it has more of the bigger rides that teens like. Be sure to stay for the light show at the end of the evening."], ["Reviewed January 5, 2018", 5.0, "Had a great time", "We recently visited Disney California Adventure Park with our 14 year old son and 10 year old daughter. They loved the rides here, they are thrill seekers so the rides suited for the older children. We went in mid December, the crowds were big but most rides we only waited for 45 mins. To miss some of the lines we used the single rider line as we weren't concerned about riding together. The Fast Pass is worth it for the photo's they were good quality. Highly recommended the Light Show that occurs at night.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 5, 2018", 5.0, "Our first visit", "This park has alot for every age group. Do yourself a favor and get the fast pass! Use it on the Radiator Springs Cars ride first! We waited 3 hours for a 3 minute ride! Great ride, not worth 3 hour wait. The Guardian of the Galaxy ride is Intense! My favorite rise is California Screaming coaster!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 4, 2018", 5.0, "Holiday", "Lots of rides and the magic of disneyland makes everyone feel like a kid again. So much to see and do. From modern rides to 50's style cafes and shows. You need at least 2 days to see it all."], ["Reviewed January 4, 2018", 3.0, "Worth visiting once", "This theme park is the right size. However, the number of rides is limited and always packed. The food variety is actually pretty good, but very very expensive. The characters are roaming around and are more approachable than at the sister park. This is an experience you have to do once for your kids, but be prepared for heavy spending. The marketing strategies used in this park are beyond perfection: out of a ride directly into the gift shop. Long queues for short duration rides. Personnel are very well trained and are very welcoming and warm to the guests.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 4, 2018", 5.0, "fun!", "using our early hour as a resort guest was well worth it. and the first hour park was open wasn't too crowded either. so, we got to do a lot of what we wanted with not very much wait."], ["Reviewed January 4, 2018", 5.0, "The best in the world", "My last trip to California Adventures, was awesome, place was great, my family and I enjoyed to the max.
