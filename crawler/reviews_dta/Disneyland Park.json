We have 3 other children. Bought 3 day hopper online only to spend an hour at the ticket booth since staff could not find the tickets in \u201cthe system\u201d conformation email apparently was not sufficient. Upon standing in line dealing with a cantankerous female booth worker we were told sorry can\u2019t find them..... So, a not so quick phone call for refund followed and we paid a premium at the booth for same tickets. Finally got in mid day whooo hooo. Met with crowds long waits, over priced food and more unfriendly staff. Mind you this was the off season too. Ordered some food screwed it up, oh well ate it anyway. Several rides closed and Arielle\u2019s Grotto closed. Daughter wanted a meal with the princesses as far as I could research there are no other establishments that offer this. Disney without princesses nice. Furthermore, parking. We made mistake of parking in the shopping area, downtown Disney. For a mere 48$ a day you can park here. We found out later after asking multiple people that you can validate it by spending money in the shopping district. Of course after we\u2019d paid 48$ twice for two days. Booth employee said bring receipt, so ate a 130$ meal for six, brought receipt only to be told nope stamp on ticket only. Asked for a supervisor to plead our case. Brian, the apparent supervisor came told us what you can\u2019t read the sign it\u2019s been there all day since 7:30. The one that says validate you see, wow. Hmmm we are morons perhaps but explained what we\u2019d been told, he said you can\u2019t read? Wow ultimately paid 96$ in one day to park since we left for naps and came back. Ticket from earlier didn\u2019t matter either. It\u2019s down right criminal. Happiest place on earth Nope just look at all the other over paying suckers and ask yourself is it? Problem is putting a price on a child\u2019s happiness a parents weakness of which Disney is the authority of exploitation. This was not our first trip been to Aulani and Disneyworld as well the service here in Anaheim fell far far short it\u2019s become an unfriendly corporate corrupt world with disgruntled unfriendly employees.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed yesterday", 5.0, "My Happy Place", "Our 10th Visit and certainly wont be our last..Disneyland brings out the kid in my 54 year old body..love the rides, park is clean..staff are excellent..cant wait to go back!!"], ["Reviewed yesterday", 5.0, "There's nothing like seeing the park Walt built.", "People get caught up in the big things here but it's the little things that Walt touched that mean the most to me.

We would scan our ticket for one ride and while in line would book the next MaxPass ride. This made for short waits and more time spent enjoying the day. We (two of us) ate at Bengal Barbecue, ordered four skewers (three meat, one vegetable) and were satisfied for the rest of the day - we also threw in a dole whip, which was very tasty and lactose-free! We also followed the advice about grabbing a cup at one of the quick-service restaurants and filling it with water at the outdoor seating areas around the park - this helped to save money. We enjoyed the light show at Small World and the fireworks. The train ride was fun - we rode it twice around the park.

This one is for anyone accompanying kids with special needs. As soon as you enter the park, go to City Hall and register the party for Return Passes. Usually one person per party has to be the carrier of the Return Passes but you can have them designate another person if your party plan different attractions. You can combine Return Passes with Fastpass so you can maximize your visit. There are 5 spots around the park marked with green umbrellas where you can reserve the attraction with Return Pass. They give you a return time usually better than the Fastpass, you go then to the attraction and use either the exit (for Pirates of the Carribean) or the Fastpass entrance. Once you\u2019re done with the ride, you can book the next ride with Return Pass. Beware that you can\u2019t book more than one ride at a time with Return Pass. But, as I said before, you can combine it with Fastpass. So if you do a little planning ahead (and use the app that shows you wait times) you can actually do a lot of rides with minimum wait time.\nMy advice is to start with Tomorrow Land since Star Tours fills up pretty quickly. We\u2019ve done this a few times and always ended up doing much of what we had planned to do.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 2 weeks ago", 4.0, "Get a MaxPass and watch out for ride closures!", "This park is more crowded than California Adventure, even on a weekday in the offseason.

We noted that from mid-afternoon the crowds grew and the lines subsequently increased.\nFood was as we expected, expensive and some areas of the park seemed to have very little choice. Toontown was very short on food options.\nMerchandise was equally expensive - they certainly make their money on the likes of mouse ears at $25USD.\nWe managed 90%+ of the rides but we didn't do any of the shows, so there is a bit of a tradeoff. My sister and her family went to quite a few of the shows but did hardly any rides - so each to their own.\nSo what would we tell others?\n1) buy a lanyard for your ticket outside of the park - they were a horrendous price inside disneyland.\n2) ask for water at the restaurants, to save on fizzy.\n3) my wife took a camelbak filled with ice and water that she used each day.\n4) Try everything - you may as well do a ride, rather than walk past one - thinking you might do it later.\n5) Buy your merchandise somewhere other than disney - our hotel had a large selection of disney gear, all cheaper.\n6) Don't go home before dark - the park really is magical at night with all the lights.\n7) There were no parades or fireworks whilst we were there - they don't start until April and they are apparently amazing.\n8) The guardians of the galaxy ride was the tower of terror - wish I'd known this before we went on it ; )\n9) If you need help - ask.

Disney\u2019s keystone in California is Disneyland itself, the original 1955 park that took elements from existing American theme parks and pleasure gardens, and perfectly fused them together into \u2018the\u2019 definitive family entertainment destination.\n\nWalt Disney World in Florida was an effort to break free of the historic limitations of the California site and, over the years, has expanded to a total of four parks across enormous acreage. The most recognisable park is Magic Kingdom and it is this park that is a homage to Disneyland. Elements are shared between the parks, but none are true replicas of one another, gentle facsimiles persist, but many seemingly familiar attractions have slight differences, and many attractions are unique to one location or the other.\nDisneyland and Magic Kingdom are therefore closely related, while California Adventure shares some of its heritage with the content of Disney\u2019s other Florida offerings: Hollywood Studios, EPCoT and, Animal Kingdom.\n\nFrom a purely package holiday perspective WDW wins, with a much larger size, it\u2019s much more capable of sustaining a family vacation for a much longer visit (the typical two-weeks that British visitors are likely to book). There are other benefits too; multiple Disney owned hotels, on-site restaurants aplenty, water parks, shopping & entertainment, and close by, Universal Florida and SeaWorld too. WDW is cleverly designed to act as the hub for all of your holiday needs and is increasingly, with dining packages, digital ticketing, multiple pre-bookable attractions, and experiences, a completely integrated Disney experience from sun-up to sun-down.\n\nDisneyland is a very different experience to its upstart younger sibling and this is where some very surprising elements reveal themselves.\n\nFor starters Disneyland is small, though they may look similar, Magic Kingdom is quite a bit larger, and Cinderella\u2019s Castle in Florida is massive when compared to Anaheim\u2019s original Sleeping Beauty Castle. The limited scale of Disneyland was a necessity of the constraints of the original site and of Walt being unable to afford more land when embarking on the project. With finances tight, Disneyland was soon hemmed-in by hotels, restaurants, and vacant lots purchased by speculative real-estate developers. Over the years, Disneyland\u2019s designers have become adept at squeezing attractions into an increasingly full plot, the result is a surprisingly intimate experience that WDW seeks to duplicate but, because of its more generous size and despite using clever tricks with scale and perspective, doesn\u2019t quite manage to replicate. Disneyland still has Walt\u2019s influence around every corner and, though planned and conceived by him, WDW didn\u2019t even break ground until after Walt\u2019s death\nSecondly, Disneyland is much more of a local\u2019s park; that\u2019s not to say that hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors, or those from across much of the USA don\u2019t venture to Anaheim, it\u2019s just that the overwhelming majority of visitors are from the LA and Southern California conurbation and this lends the park a more casual vibe. Many Californian\u2019s are day visitors or just there on short stays, and the popularity of annual passes mean that many can drop-in for an afternoon or evening visit almost any day of the week. Attendance levels can therefore fluctuate dramatically, at times outside of peak demand, particularly during mid-week, the parks can be remarkably quiet compared to Florida. Walt Disney World is becoming much more of a year-round destination to the point where crowds are flattening-out and periods that have historically benefitted from low attendances are starting to get squeezed.\n\nThe next difference is in the time you may want to dedicate to visiting the parks. Disneyland Resort (that\u2019s Disneyland and the neighbouring Disney California Adventure) can be attempted, at the right time of year, in just two days (one day for each park). In some favourable circumstances, a reasonable taster of both parks can even be managed in a single day! This opens-up Disney as a vacation excursion destination, something that can be added, but need not dominate, a busy schedule spent visiting Los Angeles, San Diego or other Californian cities and landmarks. General Admission theme park tickets start with single day options and top out at five day passes, remember to specify park-hopper tickets if you wish to skip between both parks in a single day. So, Disneyland works well as an addition to any trip that brings you to California, rather than necessarily being the focus of a long vacation. WDW is a destination that visitors commit multiple days to, with one and two week visits increasingly popular, and except for a few days at Universal Florida, many people never leave the boundaries of the Florida resort at all.\n\nFinally there are attractions in California that you won\u2019t find in Florida and some special takes on some familiar WDW favourites that are exclusive to Anaheim. Here are some of your exclusives:\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye \u2013 a high speed truck ride through a South American treasure temple\n\nThe Matterhorn Bobsleds \u2013 the world\u2019s first tubular steel rollercoaster that winds its way through the iconic Matterhorn Mountain that borders Fantasyland\n\nFinding Nemo Submarine Voyage \u2013 the famous Disney submarines given a Pixar Makeover\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout \u2013 the extremely clever and uniquely re-themed Hollywood Tower of Terror\n\nCars Land \u2013 the phenomenal multi-million dollar recreation of Radiator Springs, featuring three unique attractions centred on the popular characters from the Cars films including the amazing Radiator Springs Racers.\n\nParadise Pier and California Screamin\u2019 \u2013 currently undergoing a reimagining as Pixar Pier and The Incredicoaster (themed on the Incredibles, just in time for the film\u2019s sequel)\n\nGrizzly Peak \u2013 a water raft ride through a Californian National Park\n\nMickey\u2019s Toontown \u2013 a mash-up between the worlds of Disney Animation and Who Framed Roger Rabbit\n\nThe World of Color \u2013 A spectacular water fountain show held on the lake in California Adventure and enhanced with pyrotechnics, lasers, and animated projections\n\nAdded to these, are some attractions that manage to beat their duplicates:\n\nHaunted Mansion \u2013 from Halloween thru Christmas, this attraction is exclusively redecorated to include special theming from: \u201cA Nightmare Before Christmas\u201d, turning-it into a unique attraction that makes Florida theme park fans extremely jealous\n\nPirates of the Caribbean \u2013 This is the superior US version of the classic, with better drops and better loading and unloading (just don\u2019t look at the Shanghai Disneyland version)\n\nIt\u2019s a Small World \u2013 The Disneyland original features the iconic clock and the original world\u2019s fair outdoor beginning absent from the WDW edition\n\nSo, should you visit Disneyland? Our opinion is yes, just with some conditions. If you are visiting California, definitely try and add it to your list; you\u2019ll just have to determine how much time you\u2019ll want to spend there. We recommend between two and three days in low season and midweek, if you\u2019re visiting in high season, the two parks can get quite full and the only guarantee of seeing and riding everything may be to stretch a visit out to four or five days \u2013 depending of course, on just how \u2018Disney\u2019 you are.\n\nThere\u2019s no dining-plan at Disneyland and the park dining is limited when compared to WDW, but there are a few great restaurants inside the gates (reserve using the Disneyland App) and some reasonable offerings nearby.\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with WDW, you won\u2019t find magic-bands or advance fast passes in California, but there have been recent changes to introduce a little technological ticket management to Disneyland. For a $10 per guest daily supplement, guests can now link their park tickets to their Disney Account using the Disneyland App, benefits include an unlimited photo-pass, and fast pass reservations that won\u2019t require a visit to the attraction to get a time.\n\nTying Disney to a visit to Universal Studios in Hollywood is not as practical as the Florida Equivalent, as the parks are on opposite sides of LA and the traffic on the freeway between the two destinations can be torturous. Another great theme park experience, Six Flags Magic Mountain, in Valencia, is even further away, to the North of Los Angeles. Our advice, should you wish to add Universal and Six Flags to your itinerary, use a hotel near to Hollywood or Universal City and stay a few nights there using that as your base, before moving on to Anaheim.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for another theme park experience closer to Disneyland, you can visit Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, also in Anaheim and just a few minutes away. Disney doesn\u2019t offer any water parks at Disneyland, but nearby Knott\u2019s Berry Farm does have a reasonable offering in the shape of Soak City and Six Flags has the excellent Hurricane Harbor (both open seasonally).\n\nSo, for us Disneyland is a gem. Yes, inevitably, there is a lot of duplication between California and Florida, but there\u2019s still plenty of unique experiences too. Despite the clamour from some Disney fans that the company should replicate everything in both locations, Disney is clever enough to know that allowing each resort to have its share of exclusive attractions allows them to have a distinctive character. It\u2019s this approach that makes a visit to either location such a different and worthwhile experience.\n\nFootnote: My wife and I took our first holiday together to California, Disneyland was my first experience of a Disney park (California Adventure was still the parking lot at the time), despite having been to WDW lots of times since, Disneyland remains my favourite Disney Park, after all, they say that you never forget your first time\u2026\n\n\n\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 4 weeks ago", 4.0, "A Need to go to place for every family", "This is every kid's dream place to go and it really is a great place to go!

The second you get into the park and your tickets are scanned you can start using it. You will use your phone as your Maxpass to scan when you enter the ride.

For this one we need to get physical tickets even if you have the fast pass. I didn\u2019t know that before. These tickets help you have front seats with better view. We ended up standing at the far end and watching it but it was very difficult. My wife and I had to hold up our kids so they have a better view. The lighting show on the castle is way too good. Please don\u2019t miss this. This is open to all. Make sure you are aware of the show timings on that day and plan to be there well in advance.\n6. Lastly. Arrive early. Take breaks. Stay till late evening. If you are concerned kids will be tired and you may not be able to stay longer, don\u2019t be. We are a good example. We were there early and retuned to the hotel at midnight. Take it easy. Enjoy. I am sure we will go back to Disney in a few years.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 22, 2018", 5.0, "The week before Christmas", "We took our six year old son to Disneyland Dec 21,22,23 2017. I was afraid of the crowds and congestion. Neither one really were an issue! Using Fast-passes and the Disneyland wait time app, we saw all that we wanted except the Peter Pan flight. I refused to stand in a line more than 20 - 25 minutes. The highlight was of course Fantasmic and World of Color.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 22, 2018", 5.0, "Disneyland Family trip 2018", "Be prepared to walk a lot. I suggest to go early when the gates are opening. Go to the main ride attractions such as Indiana jones it's only a 10min wait which is nothing compare to how it gets in the day (2-3hours). I always take a bag pack and fill it up with snacks and drinks especially on a sunny day it helps a lot and it's less expensive. Tickets are over $100 and when you have a family of 5 you try to be mindful of how to save . I love Disneyland & I go every year.!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 22, 2018", 4.0, "nice but overly priced", "Glad we went to keep promise to children. The food is overpr\niced, the ride waits were long, but overall the children are so happy to be there. Our favorite ride was the roller coaster in frontierland. The paddle boat was a fun relaxing ride too. Space mtn ride was not a favorite. The train around the park was good. Some rides shut down because of the rain.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 22, 2018", 5.0, "Fabulous!", "You can never get enough of the magical kingdom. From the storybook and film characters you know and love to the fun-filled rides where you experience scenes from childhood memories or favorite shows. Everywhere you look around you are surrounded by wonderful sites!"], ["Reviewed January 22, 2018", 3.0, "Way too crowded", "Even with the Fast Pass we could only ride about 3 rides in 6 hours and we decided to leave. Not to mention power was out for 30 minutes ir more and shut down most rides. There were so many people they jmhad to stop letting them in. Fast Pass felt like a scam, it was a terrible value for my family of 5... Parking took over an hour, mot organized, getting in the gate took over an hour not very well organized. It was a miserable experience.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 22, 2018", 4.0, "A bit disappointed this time", "Park is still fun overall and kept very clean but there were many rides that kept shutting down. We were in line quite a few times when we were told the ride had stopped and they weren't sure when it would be back up. This added longer lines to other rides and made for long waits. I won't ever go there again between Christmas and New Years! The Castle lit up at night is beautiful and the rides we got on we fun and well managed.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 22, 2018", 2.0, "Swarms of people", "I expected the park to be busy but not to the extent that i experienced. Bottom line, they let too many people in. Would not go back."]]}}
