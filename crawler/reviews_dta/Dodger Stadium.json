As for public transportation, unlike many of the new stadiums which are built alongside public rail, the best you will find is a Dodger Shuttle. It runs all of the time and you simply get it from Union Station (about 2 miles east). There is no charge to ride the shuttle.

Although I knew that getting and leaving the ballpark would be a nightmare with LA traffic, the time spent between that was incredible.\n\nWhile not being a Dodger fan, it seemed that quite a bit of my baseball memories involved the history of this iconic ballpark. Seats were in the upper deck, first base side. Doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the house, however. Dodger fans were very welcoming and cordial. Is it just me or did I not notice any ushers here?

The positives... beautiful for an older park, great view of the hills, great sight lines and easy access to all levels (if you don't mind stairs as escalators can be very busy). The negatives... terrible parking setup, other parks such as Anaheim put LA to shame. The parking is made worse by the location of the park meaning you can't avoid LA rush hour. Another negative is the food, one of the worse hotdogs I have had at 16 different parks. Another negative is the prices, typical LA...be prepared to pay $50+ for two beers, two hotdogs and some chicken tenders.\n\nIf you are a baseball fan then go once for the experience.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 27, 2017", 5.0, "Historic Dodger Stadium", "I enjoy seeing new baseball stadiums every year (especially older ball parks).

The tour lasts 90 minutes, and you get to see areas of the stadium, sit in the Dodger's dugout, step on to the field dirt only), plus see all the awards etc. I highly recommend the tour (Dodger fan or not).\n\nThe seats I had for both games were great, I honestly do not believe there is a bad seat anywhere.

Found it easy I get in and out. We got there early and left after the game was over. Ticket prices varied from under $10 up to astronomical prices. Can't really go wrong not a bad view in the house. The seats are aged but not uncomfortable. The age is expected since it is the 3rd oldest park in the MLB. My wife went in for our first Dodger home game and guests services gave us a little certificate. And since we mentioned it was our 10th wedding anniversary they gave us a ball from batting practice. My one complaint is that the do not allow fans access to the wall for autographs. I've been to 4 ball parks in the mid west over the last few years and all of them allow fans access to the wall near the dugouts up to a certain point till game time.
