It bothers me that they simply canceled my appointment without any consideration for my travel plans, and without any kind of acknowledgment to the fact that I traveled to Napa to visit 2 wineries, Domaine Carneros being one of them. Because of the extreme late notice, I was not able to book any other decent winery visits for that morning. The good wineries in Napa have to be booked in advance - I foolishly chose Domaine Carneros and I suffered the consequences.\nWe did stop at Domaine Carneros the same day our tour was canceled, because we had nothing better to do, and they were not very hospitable to guests. It appears this is the down season, and they couldn't care less about the people who show up at this time.\nAs a side, I am wine geek, and I love Taittinger. I have not had great experiences with Domaine Carneros wine, but I wanted to learn more about them, and I'm still giving their wine the benefit of the doubt. I've had their Tete de Cuvee, Le Reve, several times, and it's never measured up to the price tag.

Jean-Claude was our guide, and you know it was a great time when hugs were shared all around with this kind, smart and funny man before we left. In fact, they had a hard time getting us out of there because we were having so much fun. I was the reservation maker. It was a snap to make the reservation, and upon arrival, they knew exactly who we were and whisked us off to a tasting room to begin our tour and tasting. Jean-Claude immediately poured us all a glass of their wonderful bubbly and after a toast - and with a glass of champagne style wine in our hands, we began our tour. Jean-Claude is fascinating to listen to - he is one of those professors (he is a retired prof) that if he taught the phone book, I would take the class just to hear what he had to say. He easily fit in to our group ranging from some newly-minted 21 year olds to those of us in middle age. There were breaks throughout the informative tour to refill glasses and try other wines. I am a fan of Taittinger wines, so I loved learning about the process of making the wines in the champagne style and even about the variances in climate between Napa and Champagne. The cheese plate and Pinot Noir that ended the tour were excellent. Several of us joined their wine club because we were so impressed with the quality of what we were drinking. As I say, we were having so much fun that we didn't want to leave. Jean-Claude arranged for us to stay in a nice air conditioned room (it was a weird weather weekend in Napa with temps over 100 degrees that day, outside was not pleasant!) and helped us pick out a couple of bottle to open and enjoy. I would love to go back when the weather was more agreeable to enjoy the beautiful views off the front terrace with a glass of bubbly.
