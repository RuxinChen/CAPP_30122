We have two kids, one 21 years old and the other 6 years old. We've done Disneyworld and Disneyland to death and continue to do it, because the quality of their parks have no equal.\n\nSo, how does Anaheim Downtown Disney compare to Orlando Downtown Disney? Anaheim Downtown Disney is compact. Since Disneyland is surrounded by a mix of hotel properties and residential neighborhoods, space is at a premium. The Anaheim location is easily half the size of the Orlando area. In Anaheim, the Downtown Disney serves as a prequel to entering either the Magic Kingdom or the newer California Adventure. There's no fee to enter the area but there is tight security. There's a movie theater, multiple shops and restaurants, a Disney store, etc.. The Orlando version is an entity unto itself with many more shops, stores and restaurants to offer.\n\nWhere Downtown Disney Anaheim loses to Orlando in size, since there's a more compact space, Disney's been forced to condense the magic (decor, iconic imagery, etc.) into a smaller location. This gives Anaheim's location a whole lot more charm. It feels much more like you're in Disney than the Orlando location, which feels a lot more spread out and pre-planned.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 15, 2018", 3.0, "Great place, lacked a bit of atmosphere but still awesome", "Love downtown in Orlando and this is not quite as good but still ok.

So enjoyed the build a Bear with Pok\u00e9mon characters. LEGO store is amazing ! Lots of stores and bakery, shops for kids. There is also clothing, art, jewelry for teens and adults ! Be sure in the World of Disney store to ask for a pin if you have a birthday or your first visit. You can also ask any cast member to trade pins for your lanyard. Next favorite store is the Ride Maker where your child can help you put together a car wheels, tires, body and then pick after market items like a siren or spoiler. Such fun! If it\u2019s a hot day there is ESPN to watch sports and a movie theater. Most reasonable price place is Earl of Sandwich with the best by far sandwich you will ever have ! Try the All American ! It\u2019s thanksgiving on toast bread. Incredible ! Have fun\nAt Downtown !!! Now when you have a special occasion try Jazz Kitchen and order the chocolate bread pudding. Let me know how you like it!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed December 8, 2017", 3.0, "Not What I Expected", "I was a little disappointed in DD, we went to have dinner at Ralph Brennans , I guess it was not what I expected nothing at all like the Disney Parks."], ["Reviewed December 8, 2017", 5.0, "Awesome as always", "Downtown Disney has had some changes since our last visit.

The majority of restaurants have stayed the same, except House of Blues will now become the new bowling alley (Disney Springs has this already in Orlando, FL.).\n\nAdditionally if you enjoy eating at the Rain Forest Cafe, get your fill now because the restaurant will close next summer to make way for the new hotel/resort addition.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 27, 2017", 5.0, "The new security makes is easy to visit", "I love the new plan for security before entering downtown Disney.
