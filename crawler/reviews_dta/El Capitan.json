The driver recommended not giving off at the picnic area; that the best photos and views were the next stop, and soon we arrived at a stop near a bridge. Very beautiful spot. In the nearby meadow, several folks were already setting up big scopes to watch the climbers, and I understand that at certain times during the day the rangers set up more for the convenience of the tourists. We brought our binoculars and they served nicely. It was fun viewing all the nooks and crannies that make El Capitan, and it was a special treat to pick out groups of climbers here and there along the rock wall from different vantage points along the meadow area. Popular place - even at mid-morning, the place was jam-packed with cars and RVs all along the road for quite a distance. We enjoyed the morning there and actually caught the same shuttle later in the day because we realized it looped around to the Swinging Bridge after the El Capitan stop. Sadly, this journey was accompanied by multiple sirens because a large section of rock had broken free and aid cars and rescue workers were rushing to the scene. The people we picked up at the El Capitan stop were very shaken by the explosive power of what they had just witnessed, and we discovered later that one climber had died and another had been injured. The next day, a similar incident occurred. I had seen many people take trails that I think would deliver them closer to El Capitan. Never thought about how risky that might be.

It is a breathtaking monolith. It towers over the valley and is incredible. The granite icon can be viewed from many of the most popular tourist spots. While viewing it with the naked eye is a treat, binoculars add a special experience. On most days you can see climbers making their way up the sheer face. It's pretty amazing to look through the binoculars in early morning and watch the climbers emerge from their sleeping bags or tents while dangling halfway up.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 11, 2016", 5.0, "Stunning", "Yes it really is that stunning and impressive.

FYI, the best time to visit Yosemite NP would be in May, before Memorial Day weekend hits and the crowds start to become overwhelming; or in the fall, sometime after Labor Day weekend, when the crowds have thinned.
