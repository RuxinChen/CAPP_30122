Trip tips...get here early because parking gets full fast during peak hours. Bring binoculars for far viewing and a camera (or a good camera phone). Jackets are recommended because it gets kinda chilly and windy. Also, don't limit yourself to a particular area. Walk around a bit because there's always something different to see.\n\nWe actually saw a baby elephant seal on this trip!
