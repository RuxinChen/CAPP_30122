At first I just wanted to see what shoo were in there, and maybe grab a bite to eat before heading back to merit lake. There were many shops and eateries in this building, and since I had frozen trader Joes food back at my hotel freezer, I really didn't want to purchase an entr\u00e9e. I decided to stop at El Portend Empanadas, for a empanada. The empanada was cold, and it would've been nice if the server offered to warm it up...but she didnt. She was more interested in her conversation with another employee. So, I ate my cold empanada, and once finished, I had a craving for a glass of wine. Luckily, Ferry Plaza Wine Merchant was 10 paces away. They are a wine bar and a wine retailer with fairly knowledgeable staff. I really love champagne, but wasn't willing to pay a premium for a dry bubbly, offered on this menu, so I ordered a rose, a chardonnay, and a sparkling wine. Not all together, but as I finished each glass. They were all good, I am writing this review more than 4 weeks after returning jome, so excuse my inability to remember the names of the wines. My day had come to an end, and within 5 minutes I had an uber waiting for me outside the ferry building to wisk me back to my hotel. So, my take is, check it out, but know that you will be paying a premium for everything.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 16, 2017", 5.0, "great place to browse and see localproduce and upsale merchandise", "Great place to walk especially on mfarmers market days.
