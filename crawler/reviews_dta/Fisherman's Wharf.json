There are two old Navy vessels open for tour as well as The Hyde Street Pier, which showcases an exhibit of historic ships. The Aquarium by The Bay and the Sea Lion Center are located in this area too for those interested in viewing aquatic life up close.

There\u2019s lots to see, lots of things to blow your money on (including fast-talking panhandlers), lots of restaurants and it\u2019s just fun to wander around.\n\nMy daughter and I were there recently on a pre-Christmas jaunt to the city, and I have to say the reduced crowd sizes and the ongoing holiday buzz added to our fun. The festive decorations provided an air of revelry you don\u2019t see at other times of the year, and everyone just seemed happier than usual. We enjoyed just wandering around, shopping, eating and enjoying the sites.\n\nThis was my second December trip to San Francisco, and, frankly, it\u2019s my favorite time to visit.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed December 30, 2017", 5.0, "Holiday Xmas Vacation", "Yes this is a huge tourist attraction but lots of restaurants to eat all budgets and lots of people watching, a fun place to go!"], ["Reviewed December 30, 2017", 4.0, "Pretty cool to see", "It is pretty cool to see... but the food is not very nice and at lots of the street food stalls the food was cold."], ["Reviewed December 29, 2017", 5.0, "Fun experience", "Great place full of food and shops!
