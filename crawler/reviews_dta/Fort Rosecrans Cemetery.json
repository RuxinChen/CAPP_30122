We were immediately pulled in by the place; it's rows of white headstones, the green rolling hills of grass, the windswept trees and the awesome views of the Pacific ocean on one side and the San Diego harbor and city views on the other. It's easy to start walking down the rows and to start reading the headstones and thinking about the military men and women, and their spouses, who are buried there. One thing that caught my interest was the different symbols that the military uses for different religions. I took a bunch of pictures so when I got home I could go to Google and find out what they represented. I did that and now am knowledgeable about that subject.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 8, 2016", 4.0, "A dramatic roadside monument", "In among the graves of family members and veterans who never were in combat are those of men and women who died bravely in wartime.
