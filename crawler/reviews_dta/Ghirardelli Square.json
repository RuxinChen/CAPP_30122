The chocolate is world-class, but you have to try the Painted Ladies, an assortment of ice cream sundaes in tall glasses. Worth the trip all by themselves. Have dinner in one of the restaurants overlooking the bay, and try to time your trip so you're there at sunset - the pictures you get as the lights come on are terrific.
