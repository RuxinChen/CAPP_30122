There are no long waiting lines to enter the park or on the mountain. You need to have chains with you. Buy or rent them. Even if it is not necessary to put them on you must have them with you. Rangers made us put on the chains well before it was necessary. This is really not good for the tires but ok. Up on the mountain there was Lots of snow and beautiful sights. The small museum is good for a short visit. On the way back down we took of the chains quite soon. We also had to wait 10minutes because the police was stopping the traffic for god knows what reason.

You can travel the world visiting beautiful mountains and forests, but the Giant Sequoias are so unique and so impressive, it truly takes your breathe away at every corner.\n- The wildlife: deer, squirrels, birds, and even saw a black bear cross my path on the last day!\n-The peacefulness: with so many trails, the moment the you get away from the main tourists trails, you find yourself alone amongst the trees. We walked several times over an hour with crossing anybody.\n-Trails: the trails are well maintained and easy to navigate. Also, there is not a very big elevation change throughout the park, so you can walk for hours and not be exhausted. It is basically like the ultimate nature walk!\n\nRecommendation: if you want to do some hiking, buy the $3 map at the museum, it is totally worth it.\n\nWe also wanted to visit Crystal Caves, but the tour was cancelled at the last minute because some rocks had fallen across the path and was deemed too dangerous.
