But...and this is a big but...you would be well advised to set aside a morning or afternoon to hop in your hot rod and drive up to Glacier Point. My trusty GPS did a great job of taking us along the winding roads that got us to the rest stop along the main highway toward Wawona. Be sure not to miss it; we got so used to winding and rocking and rolling that we almost drove past it. The road to glacier point takes off from the rest stop. It is extremely steep and winding, and you had better not have a weak heart when it comes to heights. Because of recent fires, we bulled our way up and skipped the viewpoints on the way up. Glad we did. The last 2 stops are the best. The one right before Glacier Point is absolutely awesome and we spent a lot of time there (wish I remembered the name of the viewpoint). Glacier Point is awesome with very good facilities, It is a tour bus magnet, but well worth the stop. There are few places that can rival the view from these 2 stops. Be ready to be awed. The best advice I can give for The Glacier Point stop itself is to go the full loop and park near the exit end of the gigantic parking area. When it gets busy, tour buses block you when it is time to leave, all the losers that have to stop in the middle of everything to put eyes on people that may or may not be walking to their cars, will block your way in their quest for the perfect parking spot. In fact, this place is so busy, it probably could use more parking, so that would be the one negative. Also, be advised the further down the loop you go, the less time you will spend in line waiting to use a restroom. So there; free advice from a crabby old dude with a weak bladder. Wonderful place!
