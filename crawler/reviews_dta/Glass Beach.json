The cove to the south of the access trail also has sea glass and is more difficult to climb down the trail.\nFor abalone divers and spear fishers: The south cove is a fair abalone picking spot at low tides and may be dive-able when the waves are too big to dive at other spots. I'm not suggesting this is always going to be a safe spot for you to dive for abalone or spear fish. When more exposed spots are not dive-able hover, the south cove at Glass Beach is slightly more protected from swells and MIGHT allow determined and experienced divers to get in the water.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 22, 2017", 4.0, "Go for the views", "Enjoy the views of the ocean and rocks and breaking waves - glass where we were was small pebbles but when you think of what it once was (trash/garbage dump) and what Mother Nature did to it over time its pretty cool.
