You can walk, job or bike across if you so wish which is a cool experience as well.\nAs locals we do't enjoy it in a leisurely way as much as we should. It's nice to be reminded of the beauty that surrounds us and how we should stop to \"smell the roses\" a bit more often.

It costs six dollars and is not included in a muni passport, is runs on a different system. You can use a clipper card.\n\nI think the Golden Gate Park is more fun then sausalito. But sausalito looks like a little Greece and is quite quaint. Not too much to do besides a the historic centre, food, and oh the model of the bay is pretty cool!!\n\nAnd some house ships but they're hard for me to find, I didn't see any up close.

No vacation to the City by the Bay is complete without a good look. You can see it from many places and angles, but a quick trip to the National Park shop and the displays regarding the building and structure of the bridge is well worth a look.\nAt the very least, drive across the bridge (currently $5 toll) and back (or walk, though it is a hike), but that does not give you the same opportunity to soak in the vista.

Perhaps because it's the emblem of the free-spirited San Francisco or California laid-back sunshine lifestyle we all want a bit of. Dunno. But seeing this bridge up close - again - still takes my breath away. It's only a bridge. It's not the Statue of Liberty. Or Michaelangelo's David. It's a toll road connecting two spits of California headlands into the Bay. But it's gorgeous. So lovely. A massive, metal sweep that's still gracious and gentle. How does an arc of rope and two towers do that? I gawped and gawped again. As I did in 1995 when I first saw it. There's some deliberate, delicate, delicious architecture going on here which I will never understand the reasons behind, but goes to show that if you let designers fulfil their brief, no matter what the opposition or cost-cutting (as was the case here), then you can end up with something magical. It's only a bridge. But what a bridge. Sail under it on a Bay tour and look up. Walk across it, and occasionally look up. You really should.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 3 weeks ago", 5.0, "Bike ride or walk over it is a must!", "The Golden Gate Bridge is just as beautiful as all the pictures portray it to be.
