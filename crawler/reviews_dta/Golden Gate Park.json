On its own merits, the park itself is quite beautiful with its massive Blue Gum Eucalyptus, Monterey pines, redwoods, and Monterey cypress. A cluster of museums offers good exhibits (de Young, California Academy of Sciences) with further pockets of interest like the Japanese Tea Garden and Conservatory of Flowers.\nHowever, the park in recent years has become a magnet for car break-ins.The worst area is along Martin Luther King Drive in close proximity to the de Young museum. Time and time again my husband and I stop to console distraught tourists whose cars have just been broken into (it takes thieves less than 30-seconds handiwork).\nFor insurance purposes (especially for rental cars) we send visitors to the nearby Richmond Police Station at 461 6th Ave. to report the incident. Unfortunately, the police really can't do a lot given the sheer volume of car break-ins throughout the city (plus the fact that the crime itself is considered a \"misdemeanor\").\nWARNING: leave absolutely nothing of value in your car should you visit.\nOther downsides: parking can be difficult and there are limited eating establishments (Beach Chalet at the ocean side of the park is the best but a good distance from the main attractions)\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 26, 2017", 4.0, "Beautiful", "We were unable to get parking except near the bison.
