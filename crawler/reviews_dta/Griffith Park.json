Traffic was like a slug on ice, and parking was like winning the lottery: you have a chance, but not a good one. And while the grounds are free, parking is not. There is a four-hour minimum fee, even if you only plan on sticking around an hour or so. So that's where they stick it to you: $16 bucks. Ouch.\n\nAs far the actual place goes, it's iconic and offers some of the best views of LA. So bring a camera. As for the observatory itself, it's just okay. Many of the exhibits were dated or not working at all. And because of the crowds, we were lucky just to get to a few of them. In all fairness, we went on a Sunday; which was probably a bad idea.\n\nStill, the views are great, so check them out. Just be prepared to face the standstill traffic. Welcome to LA.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 18, 2017", 5.0, "The hike!", "So worth coming to this park!

So many things to see and recreational opportunities abound! First, and probably the most well-known is the LA Zoo. It's a wonderful, modern zoo, with so many animals to see. Young children and the young-at-heart will enjoy a visit here. There are a number of hills, so taking a tram ride may be in order.\n\nOther things to do include golf, horseback riding at the equestrian center (where I spent many a Saturday a.m. riding as a youngster and teen), and even watching the local rugby teams, Plenty of places to picnic, walk and hike, play ball, and explore. (You need to be careful as there is wildlife living in the hills.)\n\nWhat would a summer's evening be like without taking in a concert at the Greek Theater? A really nice venue with a modern sound system, smaller than the Hollywood Bowl. Nestled within the pine trees, it's a terrific \"smaller\" venue (compared to Dodger Stadium, unless you want to take in a game), and the Forum or Staples Center. Check the schedule online and you can even buy tickets as well.\n\nThere are plenty of other attractions as well: The carousel, and Travel Town, and if you take a hop across the Ventura Fwy, you can visit the Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.\n\nIf you're in the LA area around Christmastime, you can thrill at the driving tour of Griffith Park with their spectacular light displays. Fantastic, but be prepared to \"take your time\", as you'll be there with many other visitors, along with people from the LA Metro area who also want to see what's become a holiday tradition.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 3, 2017", 5.0, "The view is amazing", "Standing at this lookout, you can really appreciate the scale of Los Angeles.
