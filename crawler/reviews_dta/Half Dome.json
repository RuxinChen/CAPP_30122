When climbing up or down make sure you face Half Dome. If you slip facing the rock you'll go to your knees first and have a chance to catch yourself instead of sliding all the way to the bottom.

The views at the top and the feeling of accomplishment upon finishing are some of my favorite things about hiking, and Half Dome was no different!\n\nFirst of all - apply for your permits in March. They have a day by day chart of how many people apply vs how many get them, to help you plan your trip. My husband and I backpacked in the night before our permit and stayed about 4.5 miles in, which made for really nice timing day-of. Up on the cables before almost anyone else, we were able to hang out for a couple hours and have lunch up there, and less mileage in one day. 100% would recommend doing this, but you obviously need the equipment and you need a separate permit.\n\nYou NEED gloves. Yes, you can try to be tough and do it without them, but why? They protect your hands and a rubber palm grip is helpful, as there's lots of arm involved as you're going up the cables. Yes, there's usually some at the base, but they're essentially trash. Bring your own, pack them out.\n\nI did the hike in athletic shoes, but brought boots in my pack to switch into after the subdome. Extra weight, but I'm glad I had them because the rock under the cables is slick. Imagine how many people go on the same path day after day wearing it smooth? The extra grip was really helpful.\n\nPro Tip - Reward yourself with some pizza and a Firefall Red at the pizza place in Half Dome Village when you're done. Really hits the spot after a long day of hiking! :)\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 9, 2017", 5.0, "How to do Half Dome if you're a potato (like me)", "I am not a fit person, I don't exercise regularly, I didn't train at all for this and I hiked half dome this weekend. As long as you are willing to go through some pain to do it and you have the will you can probably finish this hike and then brag about it to all your friends and check it off the bucket list.\n\nTricks I used to make it:\n- Apply for permits. Recreation.gov has a lottery for getting permits to go up the cables at the end. You can apply pre-season or 2 days before the day you are trying to get the permits between midnight and 1pm. You may have to try several times to win (weekend odds of winning are like 12%). If you have a bigger group, get each person to enter the lottery once to increase your group's odds (group size up to 6). I applied for Saturday, lost and applied for Sunday and won.\n- Sleep in the park the night before and after if possible. Even if all the sites are full, you can keep refreshing the search and wait for cancellations (which is what I did because I booked this trip 3 days before leaving). This will be harder to do in the middle of the summer.\n- Bring at least 4L of water (after Vernal Falls footbridge because it's the last place to fill up). Water reservoir sacs are best because they are light.\n- On steep sections / stairs, pace yourself or you might get too tired (ex. I might do 5 stair steps, rest for 4 seconds. On steep hills, take 12 steps, rest for 4 seconds). This will prevent your legs from every getting too tired to have to stop for longer breaks.\n- Bring GLOVES. Palms should have rubber grips. Sometimes there are some at the bottom of the cables, sometimes there are not.\n- Wear 2 layers of socks and apply moleskin to parts of your feet that regularly blister.\n- Make sure your backpack has a chest strap to reduce back pain\n- Bring a lot of snacks, you're going to burn like thousands of calories. Also make sure to eat even if you're feeling nauseous. You won't make it if you don't have regular caloric intake.\n- Bring some toilet paper in case of an emergency bathroom break. There are bathrooms at Vernal falls (bottom & top), Nevada falls, and the backpackers campground. You have to bring back all your toilet paper with you if you go anywhere else, and don't use the bathroom near the trail.\n- If you don't want to do the steep stairs at Vernal or Nevada falls... take the longer but much less steep John Muir trail that branches off shortly after the Vernal Falls footbridge. If you do the Vernal falls stairs and decide you don't want to do the Nevada ones after, you can branch off to the John Muir trail between them too.\n- Subdome is very steep and impossible to avoid to get to the top. At some point the stairs will just end and then you have to just walk up the rocks the rest of the way... so you can't avoid *all* the stairs.\n- Bring headlamps, you are almost definitely going to end up in the dark at some point. It took my group 7 hours to get to the top of subdome, 5 hours back down, and an hour total on the cables but we also spent an hour on top of half dome and a bit on top of subdome.\n- Leave early, the earlier you get there, the less people will be there. We left at 3:30am at the trail head and we arrived just at the beginning of the main crowd. Fit people usually arrived at the same time as us if they left at 5:30am.\n- Take your time on the cables, don't let anyone pressure you to go faster than you are comfortable with. There are rest stops every 5-10 feet (wooden planks).\n- You need shoes with good grip for the cables, like newer running shoes or hiking shoes. Unless you want to be slipping the whole way up and down (you might slip a bit going down anyways).\n- It's going to hurt for a few days after so don't plan more hiking the next day lol\n\nOverall this hike is an amazing accomplishment and I recommend that everyone should do it. It's hard and it's scary but that is why it is special. If you have the will to do it and a positive attitude you should be fine.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 8, 2017", 5.0, "Like be the dome", "Whenever I visit Yosemite Park I always smile when I see Half Dome.

There were still plenty of spaces left for parking, but I would imagine by 9am it might be a little more difficult to park up there. We visited in the middle of September on a weekday.\n\nWe took the Mist Trail up which included walking alongside Vernal and Nevada Falls before ascending through the forest to get to sub dome. During this grueling hike I was on the lookout for the ranger who is supposed to check your half dome permits but they were nowhere to be seen! So we effectively wasted our money paying for this hiking permit because it didn't get checked anywhere - even on our way back down there were no rangers anywhere checking permits.\n\nSub dome - this was tough and after already hiking over 3.5 hours, it's a steep section of unforgiving switchbacks with a short section of no switchbacks where you just need to make sure your shoes are grippy to get you up the steep rock.\n\nAfter getting to the top of sub dome and reaching the base of half dome, this is where you question your sanity. I can't stress enough how looking at other peoples photos and videos still doesn't prepare you for just how steep this climb is. Gloves are pretty much a must for grabbing on to the cables - there is a pile of gloves just by the start of the cables at the base to use if you haven't got any with you. You will be hauling yourself up this mountain so a good grip and grippy gloves are required, your legs don't do much work.\n\nMy husband and I came here to hike up to half dome together but I got half way up before shuffling my way back down. I just didn't want to continue, it was way steeper than what I expected and combined with the traffic and negotiation of people coming back down with a little bit of wind blowing too, I needed to get back down and plant my feet firmly on the ground haha!\n\nMy husband managed to get up there though and when I asked him about the overall experience he said, and I quote \"it was horrific\". He said the views were decent at the top but you're stood on-top of the thing that makes a great photo from other viewpoints in the park.\n\nIt was still an enjoyable experience for me sitting at the base and watching others make that climb. I wasn't the only person who turned away. There were others that didn't even attempt the cables and just walked away. I did witness one of the poles coming loose and swinging against the mountain which made a loud noise, before someone jammed it back into position. I also witnessed somebody's metal water bottle falling and banging against the rock right next to where people were making their way up - it's wise to make sure everything in your bag is in zipped compartments to stop this from happening.\n\nThe hike overall was around a 16 mile round trip which we did in a day. We took the John Muir trail back down. It took around 9 hours to complete.\n\nIf you're going to do this hike in a day please take enough water, especially in the warmer weather and also ensure you have enough food such as energy bars and fruit to give you that extra boost to get through this. We probably should've had a bigger breakfast!\n\nI would recommend the half dome hike to anyone visiting the park with an interest in long, grueling hikes. Just make sure you have good grippy shoes, a pair of gloves, plenty of water, food and a sensible approach to the climb. There were some people who were coming down so fast they were slipping and making it dangerous for others.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 28, 2017", 5.0, "See this rock from as many different perspectives as you can", "There is a minimum number of words to write a review, but frankly, this mountain, which I love, leaves me speechless.

My first time was before they limited access to those with permits, and the cable was jammed with people going up and down. That was very unpleasant, and not very safe, so I am a big fan of the permit process. You might get up and down without a permit - but don't try it. the rangers check on a random schedule.\nThe first time I did it, I was with a bunch of teens, so I fashioned harnesses out of rock climbing webbing and <real> carabiners. Each of us then had an approx 6 foot loop of webbing with another two carabiners on it. If you know what you are doing - only if - you can in this way be clicked into the cable at all times, which lessens the anxiety you might feel about clinging to a cable on a very steep rock slope. I did not use it the second time - just two of us - and I kind of missed the assurance that the harness gave me.\nYou'll need good legs, lungs and heart to make the approach hike, and you'll need reasonable arms for the climb up the cable. At least I found my upper body got quite a workout.\nI cannot overstate how tricky and aggressive the rodents are at the top. Leave no food unattended for ANY amount of time. We lost a bag of nuts that was 2-3 inches from our hips, between us.\nAlso bring plenty of water, and a means of filtering or purifying water from above Nevada falls.

Third year trying & I finally got them! And for our first choice -- our 24th anniversary on Sept 18. Unfortunately a few days before we were to leave, my husband took a bad fall on his bike and needed crutches -- so I took my sister. Now, we're both in shape, work out most days and knew the elevation wouldn't bother us BUT this hike was still extremely hard!! 19.2 miles up and back. We stayed at Half Dome Village and left at 5am with headlamps on. We decided to take the John Muir Trail up instead of the Mist Trail -- which I read was quite grueling & could really tire you out with 15 or so miles to go. The JMT was beautiful and from it we were able to see the sunrise over Nevada Falls! We continued on stopping for 5-10 minute breaks to eat high protein & carbs -- you definitely need lots of snacks to fuel you for this hike. As well as at least 3 liters of water in a camelback. We passed Little Yosemite Campground - after that is when the ascent starts again. Relatively gentle at first, then excessively harder for a few miles. Just when we thought the hard part was over, we reached the Sub Dome, which I think is the most difficult part -- even more so than the cables. It's a very steep granite rock which starts with switchbacks, very deep steps and then finally morphs into just plain granite -- no steps and very steep with drop offs on both sides. We stuck to the middle and were grateful for our very grippy hiking boots! At 9:30 am, we reached the cables -- awe inspiring and quite scary looking! We watched a couple people ascend and witnessed may people around us making the decision not to go up -- but I hadn't hiked that far for nothing. We started and again were very thankful for our grippy shoes AND our cheap rubber gardening gloves -- don't need expensive climbing gloves -- the rubber ones work the best. This portion takes a fair bit of upper body strength as you are mostly using your arms to pull you up the cables. I'm not afraid of heights but I can see why this may freak many people out. I think it took us about 15 - 20 minutes to get up to the top but when we did we were blown away. Its as if we were on top of the world. Photos doesn't do this justice, you must experience it to get the full effect! Breathtaking, exhilarating -- words can't describe it. We stayed up at the top for about an hour taking it all in & then descended the cables. It was much more crowded with people coming up so it took much longer to get down as you have to let people pass -- and its very narrow, so that's not very easy. Took 30 minutes or so and many people go down backwards so they don't have to look straight down, however, I went sideways part way and then forwards the rest. I just loved the view and wanted to keep on looking at it! We rested a bit on top of subdome and then continued back. I found hiking back much harder -- my feet started getting uncomfortable and your knees take a pounding going down. When we reached the Mist Trail, it was pretty uncomfortable for my knees -- Very very steep and lots and lots of deep steps and switchbacks. It was also very crowded since the afternoon crowd was walking up to see Vernal Falls. Felt much much longer than hike up.

Both ascents have been done in high summer.\n\nFirst, water and food. 4 litres of water is right, and I swear by a high quality water bladder with drinking tube as it encourages you to drink little and often; it's far easier to carry than multiple bottles as it moulds to your body and spreads the weight (trust me, 4 litres weights a LOT); and you don't 'stop and chug' all the time like you do with bottles, so making you absorb water steadily and keep a good, steady pace. Food- easy: carbohydrates and salts are the best, so some muesli type bars and a few bags of crisps did me great.\n\nSecond, footwear: I've worn a STURDY pair of cross-trainers both times and I swear by them. Unless you've weak ankles, boots are a weighty extravagance that will just add to your fatigue over the 16/18 miles (old hiker's maxim: \"an ounce on the foot is a pound on the body\"). However, DON'T wear ordinary trainers - stones and rocks will stab and prod at the base and sides of your feet and could injure you.\n\nThird: DOME ASCENT GEAR. I strongly urge you to take a proper climbing harness, a 24-36 inch sling, a 'pear' shaped (not ordinary) carabiner and a pair of leather gloves or strong gardening gloves. With these, your ascent and descent on the dome face is MUCH easier and MUCH safer. Remember, you think you might not fall but there's always the plonkers above you and if one of them goes and whacks into you - goodnight. The pear crab is needed because the cable thickness makes it fiddly and difficult to clip ordinary crabs onto it. We lost count of the number of folks who said they wished they had our gear as we ascended and descended.\n\nstart EARLY. I mean, SO early that it's still almost full darkness, which was 4.30 am for us in late July. You're not missing anything as the best sights are well on in the walk; also,you're minimising the time exposed to the direct heat of the sun; and lightning storms, if they do come, nearly always bubble up in the afternoons by which time you're well down on your descent - w\n\nKeep a steady, comfortable pace adjusted to the slope rather than stopping for breath lots of times. So long as you do have a water bladder, you won;t have to stop to chug bottled water all the time and can save breaks for 2-3 hour intervals - so when you do have those stops, have a GOOD one. Find shade, get your shoes off and your feet up and take in fluid and food for 15-20 mins at least. You'll feel re-invigorated, refreshed and enjoy the whole experience a lot more than just walking yourself into the ground.\n\nLastly, I'd advise going down the mist trail on your return trip as well as up rather than the John Muir. I did the Muir first time down and as well as being longer - which it is - I found it in poor condition and hard going in my tired state. They say don;lt do the mist trail because it's busy but in taking it this time I found it easy enough as well as it being a much better maintained route and about a mile shorter- to me, the mist trail on both ways was a no brainer.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 11, 2017", 5.0, "very nice visit", "i recommand you to visit half dome, it is a wonderfull dome, very big, the view from glacier point is wonderfull"], ["Reviewed August 9, 2017", 2.0, "Not worth the time", "Move on....it's difficult to get a good picture and the hiking trails are very crowded.

Instead, it is much more a \"manufactured\" experience. Crowds can be thick during the summer months.\n\nDespite the downsides (the fixed double-ropes that make it more an exercise of endurance rather than skill and creativity as well as the mileage to and from the peak and the crowds), the beauty of the peak and surrounding country cannot be discounted, hence my five stars.\n\nNote that one can gain a varied perspective of the peak by traversing the Panorama Trail (9.2 mis one-way from Glacier Point).

But that plan was shot due to winters heavy snow and the Tioga Pass road still being closed. Unable to get to the trailhead. So we decided to at least get a good hike in and get to the base of Half Dome. Since we were not going to go to the top, we did not get up at the crack of dawn to start our hike.

Stunning views of Yosemite, the lottery, the cables and the fact that Apple decided to use the image of Half Dome on their computer screens doesn't hurt either.\n\nSo a few tips if you want to go:\n\n1. Yes, you need a permit. Play the lottery, the chances to win Saturdays are skim, so try Sunday or other days. If you're local - try daily lotteries.\n2. Ideally you want to stay close, but it's hard. the camps are booked and the hotels in the parks are expensive. But you can stay a couple hours away and drive in the morning. That means you need to get up early, like 4 am.\n3. In summer it's not uncommon to see thunderstorms and rains and that means the cables will be not safe. But they tend to happen in the afternoon. So you should try to start your hike before 7 am. That also helps to find a parking spot.\n4. Waterfalls. This year there is a lot of water and the trail goes by the waterwalls. So you may get really wet and the water is cold. Consider bringing a plastic poncho.\n5. Altitude! This is a high altitude hike, so consider sun damage (bring a lot of sunscreen and UV protective glasses) and you may feel sick, so keep the food simple (sugar-based (fruits, sugary drinks) rather than fat/protein).\n6. You need non-slippery shows and gloves for the cables.\n7. The cables can get crowded, some people bring a cord and carabine so they can hook to the cable and have some rest, but unless you know how to use them - probably not worth it.\n8. The very top portion is very hard, so a lot of people leave their backpacks and go up light with a bottle of water. The squirrels will be happy to byte through your backup and take the food out.

Hiking Half Dome requires a permit. We watched lots of videos, read lots of advice and most importantly worked hard in the gym many months before hiking Half Dome.\nBest place to stay the night before the hike is in Yosemite valley. We camped in Upper Pines Campground, which is about 10 minutes walk to the trailhead.\nWe planned to get up very early, around 4 AMto start the hike. However, due to a very restless night in the campground (people arriving late, pitching tents and talking), we didn't get any sleep until 4 AM. There was no way we could hike to Half Dome without gettting any sleep.\nSo we made the decision to catch up on sleep until about 9 AM and start the hike at 10AM.\nWe knew it wasn't recommended starting the hike so late, but we really wanted to do it.\nWe decided to take the longer trail, John Muir trail which is 26.5km (16.5miles),because we knew it has a more gradual climb, rather then taking the Mist trail. We strongly recommend taking this route.Firstly, it is not busy at all,unlike the Mist trail, which has tons of people going to the waterfalls and secondly, the switchbacks are more gradual.\nThe trail rejoins Mist trail at the top of Nevada falls, where you have a great view of the waterfall. The trail will now flatten out a bit, you go through Little Yosemite valley which is a sandy trail for a mile or so. This is the only flat part of the whole hike. After this, you start going uphill again. The good bit is that this section of the trail is mostly in shade. There are warnings about bears here so watch out for wildlife. We encountered a rattlesnake here.\nThe climb will seem never ending here, so take breaks as often as you need. We just took it really slow, stopping to catch our breath. Eventually, you will reach the bottom of the Sub Dome. Your permit will be checked here. This is also the last place with tree cover, so expect to be exposed to the sun from now on. (it was a very hot day, 90 degrees F)\nHave a snack at the bottom of the Sub Dome, you will need the energy to climb it.\nLike everyone else said, you will already be really tired, but this is where the hard work begins.\nSub Dome is a series of VERY steep switchbacks for about a quarter of a mile. We had to keep stopping to catch our breath and we just took it really slow, one step by one.\nPlease note, that we are a couple who regularly work out (3 times a week) and Sub Dome completely destroyed our legs.\nAlso, this section can be quite terrifying if you are afraid of heights. At the start there are uneven stairs you follow but towards the end there are no stairs/trail at all, you just walk up the granite. I found this section very scary.\nFinally, you reach the top of the Sub Dome and you get your first view of the cables.\nWe arrived at the cables at 1.30 PM, starting the hike at 10 AM,but please note that we are quite fast hikers. Also, starting the hike so late in the day, we knew we had no time to waste and wanted to be at the top latest 2 PM.\nOnly one of us climbed the cables. Coming face to face with them, I found them terrifying, the climb looked incredibly steep. I decided to hang around at the bottom of the cables with a bunch of other hikers, who also changed their mind.\nMy boyfriend made the climb and said the beginning of the climb is not too bad but as you go further up there is a very steep section and that is the scariest part. The climb took about 20 minutes, but there was hardly any traffic there.\nJust take it easy and don't rush. Coming back down is harder than going up.\nWe started the long way back just before 3 PM. We decided to take the Mist trail so we could see the waterfalls. It was really tough on knees as you go downhill the whole time.\nWe got to the parking lot at 6 PM. It took us 8 hours to hike Half dome, including stops. It was the toughest hike we have ever done, but it was worth it too.

We live at high altitude, were well prepared, and it was still a very difficult hike for us. We hiked up the Mist Trail with our packs to the campground and while it was beautiful we learned that backpackers should go up via the Muir Trail; climbing the Mist Trail with 35+ packs is tough. We were more than ready to set up camp and rest after that portion. The next day was a relatively moderate hike. The cables get most of the attention, but the climb up the granite of sub dome was the hardest part. It should not be treated lightly. Definitely bring gloves for the cables and expect delays as people inch their way up and down. The first 14 miles of the hike is all uphill and strenuous, but the last portion up the cables is all about upper body strength because you literally pull yourself up the steep granite surface. We climbed at the end of the season and though we had permits there was no ranger checking for them.

I was delighted to achieve this ambition this summer.\nI applied in the march lottery for a permit and was gutted not to get one. Luckily I was staying in the valley for 5 days so I had plenty of chances with the daily lottery and got one on the second attempt. There's plenty of info on the NPS website on how to do this.\nOnce I'd got my permit I made sure I was prepared (I'd been doing research for months in advance). I had a camelbak with 2 litres in, a 500ml bottle of water and a 500ml Gatorade. So 3 litres of fluid and I used it ALL! Make sure you come prepared! There is no more filtered water after the vernal falls footbridge, which is only about 1 mile into the trek. I filled up here on the way up and way back, so probably consumed about 4 litres total and could probably have done with more. I know some people bring filtration devices with them. Other than fluids, I had loads of snacks and a full lunch to eat at the top. I also had a compass just in case, my phone, solar power charger, head torch, torch, gloves with rubber palms, energy gels, go pro, hat and suncream! Like I said, be overly prepared!\nMy day started at 4 am for breakfast and I left at 5 as I wanted to be back for lunch. The shuttle isn't running at this point, so I walked from curry village to the trail head at happy isles, which I'd estimate is about a mile. It was dark until about 6am, so I was walking the trail in the dark up to the top of vernal falls. Was spectacular seeing the moon set and and sun rise!\nI went up the mist trail on the way up and it was almost deserted (used John muir on the way back as the mist trail would have been very busy). There are then toilet facilities at the top of the falls.\nIt's fairly easy to follow the trail, just look for what looks like the most obvious route, and when you've crossed the footbridge in between vernal and Nevada falls, if you're not sure, just just take the left(ish) route.\nYou're given a little respite from the incline when you get to little yosemite valley, which is about half way. Here you walk through the woods, which is a bit sandy, so stick to the side to avoid wasting energy. You then weave up through the woods and eventually break through the tree line. I saw more people here as they camp over night in little Yosemite valley to give themselves a head start.\nNext is the switch backs up the subdome, which I found hard work! The reward is that you get to see half dome in all its glory. The 360 views are quite ridiculous too and some of the best and most awe-inspiring I've ever seen. Take a little breather if you need to and get those gloves on ready for the cables, even with gloves I still got blisters and calluses on my hands. If you do forget them, sometimes people leave old ones at the bottom of the cables, but I wouldn't rely on that. I wore trail running shoes and they were just about sufficient for the steep and smooth granite surface. I'd imagine trainers wouldn't cut it and hiking boots would be best.\nAs it was still early, there were only a handful of people on the cables, however it's important that you're sensible around other people on there - give them time, don't rush them and make sure you manoeuvre around them carefully if necessary. Do not go up there if it's raining or could rain, that's very dangerous and there is a sign explaining this. Once you reach the top, you realise the sheer size of it, its is HUGE. So huge in fact, I put my bag down, went for a wander and couldn't find it again! Spent at least half an hour looking for it, so be careful. Super views of Yosemite valley and glacier point from up here. I spent a while relaxing eating my lunch ready for the return trip.\nGoing down the cable is HARDER! I went backwards/sideways. With both hands on the left cable I lead with my left foot sideways and took the pressure on that and eased/shuffled/slipped my way down. I hate walking down hill, so once off the cables and off the subdome I walked/ran whenever I could to maintain the momentum and save my knees. Worth noting that the nearest toilet on the way down is at the top of Nevada falls. Taking the John muir trail down seemed to take forever.\nI got back at 12:55PM so achieved my aim of getting back for lunch. Obviously the shuttles were working by this point so I could take that back to curry village.\nSome people take 10-12 or even 14 hours to do this hike, however I was only travelling for about 6 and a half hours, so you can do other stuff for the rest of the day too. This kept me out of the sun for too long too!\nBefore I forget, when I got to to cables (about 8:30AM) there was no ranger to check permits, however when I was heading down, he was there at the base of the subdome to check, a printout or a screenshot on your phone is fine.\nWith my additional walk at the start, wandering around a lot and taking the John muir trail back down, the 15-16 mile hike turned into a 20 mile hike.

I had been anticipating this hike and was somewhat nervous about the Sub-dome climb--more so than Half Dome itself. Sub-dome was tiring, but not scary at all. It is narrow with a lot of steps. I just focused on the climb and was at the base of the cables before I knew it. When we arrived at the cables, only a handful of other climbers were there and they were about 3/4 of the way up. We were able to get right on the cables and start climbing. Admittedly, I didn't look around a lot as I climbed. I really just focused on getting from one board to the next. Every time the person in front of me moved up a board, I moved up a board. We kept a decent pace, resting briefly on each board. Next thing you know, we're at the top admiring amazing views! We stayed at the top for awhile and then it was time to head down! Eeeek! This is what I was most nervous about! I decided to use a deadlift grip* on the cable (*left hand underhand grip, right hand overhand grip) and sort of go down sideways (somewhat facing the cable and somewhat facing out). It was a piece of cake! I actually took time to look out and admire the views on the way down which I didn't do on the way up. Going down was the same as going up...when the person in front of me moved to their next board, I moved to mine. Good flow. I was disappointed when I made it to the bottom.

Your ankles are in full flexion climbing up and full extension and supinated/pronated coming down! Work on calf strength and ankle flexibility!\n\nFor those that complete Half Dome as a day hike, I can imagine it may be more taxing doing the 16+ mile round trip hike. Since I was backpacking and set up camp only 4.5 miles away, I only had a 9 mile round trip hike.\n\nIt's definitely worth the check mark on the bucket list!

But despite that elevation gain, there were plenty of moderate parts to recover. The famous cables get all the attention, but for me the worst part was the climb up the sub dome. It's unsupported and very narrow. I was worried about being too tired to come back down safely, but the return trip had better footing than expected (and I was still on an adrenaline high), so there were no problems. I would not attempt this if there were any moisture at all on the trail.\nThen the cables. The wood rails between the metal poles holding the cables give you an opportunity to rest, but your hands/forearms will be screaming.

As to the sub dome \u2013 my advice is to set a comfortable pace \u2013 hike a certain number of steps and stop to rest, then repeat \u2013 in manageable \u201cchunks\u201d the sub dome is very doable (despite the visual prominence) \u2013 As to the cables \u2013 it's a lot of upper body strength \u2013 I was dehydrated but not tired \u2013 my kids were very tired \u2013 its likely you will be waiting regardless due to crowds so as long as you are comfortable with your grip and shoes \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n\n6) Shoes \u2013 advise using cross trainers or hiking shoes - check the tread\u2013 however all three of my teenage kids wore running shoes (one with a very worn out tread) and managed it \u2013 although more tread and support would have helped.\n\nOverall a very satisfying hike \u2013 not as hard as Whitney (or Shasta) \u2013 but the trip has a lot of payoffs (outstanding views from the top \u2013 passing two waterfalls \u2013 the uniqueness of going up the cables).\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 9, 2016", 5.0, "Part of Lasting Adventures Trip", "Personally, this scared me half to death but it was still a great experience (other people had no issue doing this, some were more unsettled than I was, it's unique to each person).

I hiked a lot in the White Mountains of NH to get in shape for this hike (about 7 times up different mountains, some quite steep, but the longest hike I did was only 9 miles) so I was worried about whether I could do 17. FYI I am 55 y/o and I saw many others around my age and older on the trail. Everything we read estimated 10-14 hours to complete so we started early. We parked in trail head parking and began our trek with head lamps on at 5:00 am and took the Mist Trail. The hike was beautiful and varied. It starts out steep and ends steep but isn't so bad in the middle. You hike through Little Yosemite Valley which is actually flat'ish in the middle with large Ponderosa trees etc. The different scenery distracted me and made the hike go by quickly on the way up. The sub dome is very steep but fun and the cables aren't for those with fear of heights! We actually had a permit, but no one ever checked for it. When we were up there we were told by other people that if you get to sub dome early ( we were there by about 9:00am) there isn't always a ranger there yet to check permits. Gloves are a must for the cables more for going down than going up in my opinion. The challenging part of the cables is that people are going down while you are going up and it gets tricky! I do not have a strong upper body but was able to pull myself up those cables...don't worry it isn't that hard. Only a little scary when my feet lost grip occasionally but so worth it!! The return hike started to seem endless from the waterfalls down. We finished by 2:30 (only 9 1/2 hours)!

We took the Yosemite Valley Shuttle to stop 16 and followed the Mist Trail to the top. This is a very strenuous and long hike that will take you at least 10 hours to complete--it took us 13 hours as we stopped to take pictures and have lunch. Climbing the cables was nothing compared to the last 900 feet of the trail which was very strenuous and steep. I didn't find the cables to be too difficult but they are not for someone who has a fear of heights. The hardest thing about climbing the cables was that other hikers were coming down when we were going up and vice versa. At times we had to swing to the outside of the cables to let others go by. I would recommend a thin pair of gardening gloves as they helped me grip the cables and prevented metal splinters. You may also find it helpful to clip yourself to the cables for added security.\n\nThere is only one stop for water on the trail and it is located in the beginning near Vernal Falls. We had plenty of water between us but still ran out due to the difficulty of this hike so pack extra. Before we left for our trip, we heard that other hikers had spotted a mama bear and her cubs on the trail so we attached bells to our packs to alert them to our presence. Fortunately, we had no encounters with bears but we did encounter a surprised rattle snake which could have ended badly.\n\nWhile this hike was very long and strenuous, it was well worth the views and was an experience of a lifetime.

Take twice as much water as you think you will need! This. Is. No. Joke. We ran out water on the way down and there isn't a place even to filter water until you get below the falls.\n2.

As a British family of two parents and two teenagers who do sport we are pretty fit. We have also walker and done trekking before. How hard can Half Dome be?\nThe truth is that it is really quite scary due to; the steepness, the polished granite underfoot and the fact that if you trip over or lose your footing you will quickly slide down the cliff to your death.\nWe started the summit at sunrise when it cool and there was no-one about. I can not recommend this enough. My 13 year old son could not make it up due to nerves and it took all of my will power not to bottle out when I was half way up and my wife was struggling with the height.

Roughly 16 miles minimum, maybe more depending on route and where you park. Keys to success, take enough water, start early, keep moving, and pace yourself. Also, gloves for the cables. The crowds near the falls on the descent were the worst part of the day, by far.\n\nThe cables get all the attention, but the 'stairs' up the sub dome take some effort as well, and have a bit of exposure.
