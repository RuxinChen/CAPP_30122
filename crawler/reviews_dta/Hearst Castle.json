The history of the place and its connection to American history are without parallel. The glamour of the place and the movie stars who used to part there is amazing. What's especially incredible is that the vast majority of the place is in its original state from when it was occupied by William Randolph Hearst. I've been to many castles and chateaus that have been rebuilt or re-furnished to simulate its original state. Hearst Castle is one of the few where almost everything is original. And then there are the spectacular views and the incredible drive up to the mountaintop where the castle is located. Wow! It is definitely worth a visit and count on spending a few hours there. Don't miss the 45 minute film on the building of Hearst Castle at the visitors center. It's shown on a 5-storey tall screen! The clarity and production values are unbelievable. A lot of serious money was spent making the film and it is very, very interesting.

Four: There are no combo tours. We would have probably taken a combo if they offered it, like Grand Rooms and Bedrooms if it was offered. Since we didn't know how the time would go, we didn't book back to back tours. A combo tour would have come in handy.\n\nThe castle itself is very impressive especially already having seen the film.

It is incredible and worth any amount of time you spend there.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 26, 2017", 4.0, "Impressive but....", "The location makes it stunning and the castle itself is nice and we appreciated the logistics of building on the top of the hill.\nWhatever you do EAT BEFORE YOU GET THERE as they charge a OUTRAGEOUS price for everything. A simple candy bar is $2.99 n potato chips are the lil lunch size bag you put in kids lunches and they charge $2.99 as well.\nWe understand pricing but this is borderline thievery and I was shocked people were buying anything.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 25, 2017", 5.0, "The bungalow got out of hand", "Hearst's original plan for a small bungalow on the hill got a bit out of hand ! There are several different 1 hour tours (see the website). Book a couple of tours (you can stay up at the castle between tours if you time them both right : the help desk or online support will help you time this, saves going back down the hill then back up again). We booked the Grand Rooms tour and the upstairs rooms tour (particularly enjoyed the upstairs rooms tour). Tour guides were very informative and mixed in just the right amount of anecdote and humour.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 25, 2017", 5.0, "WOW", "Very informative tour of a legendary facility. Well done & efficient operation. We only did the Grand Room tour and the movie, but still spent over 3 hours on site. Well worth the price of admission."], ["Reviewed September 25, 2017", 4.0, "Nice venue to visit", "Interesting to see the views from the top of the hill and to do one of the tours. The amazing exterior pool is being repaired but the interior pool is stunning!"], ["Reviewed September 24, 2017", 5.0, "Fantastic", "A must do if you are in the area.\nWe had been previously and toured the main house so this time did Cottages and Kitchen followed by Upstairs Suites. Lots of walking and stairs but well worth the effort.\nGuides are really knowledgeable and friendly.\nOutside areas and gardens can be roamed at your leisure after your tour so allow additional time.\nViews from the Castle grounds are amazing.\nShow less"]]}}
