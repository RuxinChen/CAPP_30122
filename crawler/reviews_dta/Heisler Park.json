It takes you past the Las Brisas Restaurant. Along the way, there are many sculptures not to be overlooked. Many are outstanding visually, one stands out as historically significant. It is a 9/11 memorial. It is a silver ball with construction debris from 9/11. There is a free walking tour of Laguna Beach that includes this walk and explains the art works. Well worth taking.

Its natural beauty on the shoreline is a must if you go to Laguna Beach and just want to walk or stroll alone or with friends. The city has put a lot of money redoing the park with wonderful art and landscape. There are lots of places to sit, hear music, lie on the grass, go into the surf below and picnic too with lots of tables and benches. They have Lawn Bowling you can watch and also maybe try out, and lots of wonderful private places to be in. The bathrooms are usually clean and its kid and dog friendly. There are no outdoor swing sets, but always spaces to enjoy. They have an unusual and beautiful and very spiritual sculpture by an artist named Jorge Dubin with a piece of the steel from the 911 remains from The NYC World Trade Center. Go there and reflect about life. There are also pieces of art to honor the military. The artwork all over is wonderful, bring a camera because there are lots of things to photograph.
