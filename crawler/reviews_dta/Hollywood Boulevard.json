Don't lay on the stars, they aren't cleaned often, and someone puked on them last night stumbling out of a night club.\n2. The people with the purple shirts that say $5 Sale at the $10 store are there every single day. It's a scam. The prices have never once been $10, that is why they have shirts printed with sale on them, and why those shirts are faded from the sun.\n3. You don't have to tip the superheros. You should, it is how they make their living and LA is expensive, but they legally can't tell you what they charge or demand money from them. If you tell them that you know this they might back off. If they don't then threaten to report them. But only if they are being hostile... and honestly, you should tip them.\n4. Every bus tour is the same, but right near the end of the day you might catch a deal as they are trying to make a few bucks extra for the last tour of the day. In the morning though, forget about it.\n5. If you are looking for a specific star or celebrity, you can google it. Google will provide you with websites that tell you the exact address for Ringo Star, Betty White, and Brittany Spears.\n6. There are two people named Michael Jackson. One made music and then died. His star is near the Chinese Theater. The other Michael Jackson was a radio DJ in Ohio who got very old.. but last I checked is still alive. His star is on Vine and has a microphone on it.

It would have been fine if those were the last available seats but they weren't. The people behind us were put in 2 seats four rows back from Jimmy. That was biggest complaint, the rest is basically because I have been to The Colbert show which set a standard Jimmy didn't even come close too. We stood in a long line there too, but we were walked in and ushered in, row by row. Where you were in line, determined how good of a seat you got, as it should in a general seating line. Also, Stephen Colbert came out before the show started and talked to the crowd for quite a while. He also explained things that were going to happen as the show went along. John and the band put on a great performance before Stephen came out and there was a warm up comedian before they played who was funny. Even after the show and Stephen runs out high five-ing people on his way out, he came back in and talked to us again and thanked us for coming. If you go to see Jimmy Kimmel expect to see what you see on TV and not much more. There is a warm up comic who was not funny, and he is just telling us to scream more than trying to say any sort of jokes, but who cares, you don't come to see him....Then all of a sudden they roll the credits on the tv monitors and Jimmy comes out. After a monologue, they went to commercial and Jimmy is talking to people on stage, similar to Colbert. They came back and he did another monologue and video clips/skit, then at the next commercial, he talked to the crowd for 3 to 5 minutes, well, just one couple in the front row really. After that, the guests would come out, they would have commercials the same way with celebrities and staff talking on stage, then each guest, when done, the comic would say, Say thanks to so and so! and we would clap and the would leave out the door. After the second guest left, we thought we would see the singer, but then they said, Say thanks to Jimmy! and off he ran out the doors just like the guests and that was that.No thanks for coming, or anything. Apparently, they had prerecorded the singer. The stage producer/director, I'm not sure who he was, had come out and talked to us in line before the show and said the guests that would be on the show. It included the singer who we never saw, and he even said Jimmy's cousin was going to be there to cause some mischief. He wasn't.

You can also email them in which you will immediately receive an automatic acknowledgement but never a response (I sent 6). Finally I was able to chat with a rep and get it resolved. Next week is the tour. A little worried because I see on Yelp that we will be lucky to have the tour guide show up. But, fair is fair.

Home to the films, the glitz and glamor. Visiting this place once is a must for ardent movie-goers who are fascinated by the characters. But once you have spent about 5 mins in this place, you realize there is nothing much to do (except drive up the hill to the Hollywood sign). The place is filled with stores and shopping malls mostly selling souvenirs. Plenty of restaurants making the best use of the opportunity to get some customers. And other attractions & studios spread around.\nSuggestions - The boulevard does house some known attractions to see, like the Walk-of-fame, Madame Tussauds, Ripley's Museum, the wax museum, lot's of famous theaters. If you (may) cover all those, go for the drive to the Hollywood sign, or even trek to there on a good, sunny day.\nCareful - There are lots of characters dressed as your favorite stars looming around the area who hustle you for a pic in exchange for the green papers. There will also be agents who try to get you one a ride around the place to show movie star houses and other things nearby (that ain't gonna get me sold). This place gets super, super crowded. Both the roads with traffic and the sidewalk with people.

There was a movie premier going on so you could barely see Grauman's Theater and the sidewalk was blocked off so you couldn't see the celebrity handprints. The stars on the sidewalk were neat but they were difficult to see as you had to constantly be aware of all of the people you were bumping into.
