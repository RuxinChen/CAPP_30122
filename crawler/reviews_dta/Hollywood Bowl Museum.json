And if you gotta go, you want to go to a place like this. And while it does hold a lot of people (about 18,500), there are bigger places out there. It's funny but all throughout the concert, it felt more intimate than big.\n\nIf you go, I would recommend you do the park and ride - there are a number of them around the area. Got tickets for the park and ride thru ticketmaster (same as show) and was about $12 I think. But it was so worth it. The parking that I saw was stack parking (you know first in first out), but to even get your car moving if you were first in line with all the people walking around - we preferred to let someone else drive (about 45 minutes from Torrance parking lot). Return bus easy to to find and timing was perfect (even stopped in the bathroom before we went).\n\nBeen here a couple of times now and am more and more impressed with it. Great food and drink options (and you can bring your own in - no open containers). We saw people bringing in small coolers. We just took ourselves and zipped through a line as we had nothing that needed to be looked into.\n\nOnce we got in, had to check out the food options (as I did not want to leave once the concert started). Lots of options including a store that sells snacks, wine, beer etc. Yeah, yeah, yeah the food is expensive but so what, you are here to have a good time and enjoy the music. Got some food and were on our way to find our seats. Laid out nicely so you can take specific routes to your section (lower, higher etc.). Had escalator & elevator to the upper section.\n\nSeating in the first few sections are actual seats with the further back sections having \"seats\" - numbers on benches. There are also some box seat sections so if you have more people, you can get these. Giant screens on each side of the stage so even if you are further back you can see.\n\nTheater is open air so summer time is a great time - lots of stars and fresh air while you rock out to your favorite musicians. Acoustics were good and indeed as they sang \"We will rock you!\" - was so true. Left that night feeling thoroughly rocked.

There frequently are tickets turned in by subscribers, last minute is possible on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nThe Lucques Group is the new food operation for the Bowl. It is a massive improvement over the previous group. Better service, many more selections than before. While it is pricey, the quality is consistently excellent. The BBQ dinner for two was perfect for the evening, plenty of food and leftovers to take home.\n\nIf you are sitting in benches, I highly recommend you buy an extra seat for your group. It is a big help especially if you are picnicking to be able to spread out.\n\nIf you are visiting L.A. during the summer season, spend a night here, you won't be sorry.\n\nLast note, park and ride or shuttles allow you to avoid the stack parking which is guaranteed to lengthen depature time (It was 45 minutes last night parking in Lot A).\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 2, 2016", 4.0, "Great venue for a concert but getting there can be a challenge", "Saw Sting and Peter Gabriel on July 18th. Was a great concert , beautiful venue and the sound was awesome. We stayed nearby but we are not in shape enough to walk the hills to get there so we drove. It was 25 bucks to park and they do that \"Stack\" parking so you can't leave early. Also for this concert you couldn't bring in alcohol but bottled water/soda and snacks were ok. Our seats (and most) were wooden benches so for a buck you can rent a cushion. We had a great time and met some really nice people but i would recommend getting there very early and picnicking if you drive or use public transit/uber etc. Large beer was 16 bucks so pricey.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 2, 2016", 5.0, "Glorious music-filled evenings under the stars", "I have visited the Hollywood Bowl every summer since I was a child, as have many other Angelenos.\n\nBlockbuster shows on the weekends, some with fireworks. Classical on Tuesday and Thursday. Jazz on Wednesday. World music on Sunday.\n\nThere are plenty of picnic opportunities, so come early.

We were in the last row of the boxes which was a long way from the stage. However, there are large screens which one can see with ease or bring binoculars. Large crowds so transport is slow arriving and departing. An experience\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 30, 2016", 5.0, "One of a kind venue", "Even forgetting the history, this is a excellent facility. It has excellent site lines, even in section S everything was visible, very small of course, but no obstructions from the rows in front. They also have sufficient help to guide you through the complex and to your seats. Sufficient rest rooms are always nice as well.\nWe took the shuttle bus from the zoo and I can't emphasize how convenient and stress free it made the event.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 29, 2016", 3.0, "This is an open air theature and not a museum", "We visited it as part of the Grand LA tour, It was very big and they usually host some show / event in it"], ["Reviewed July 29, 2016", 4.0, "Fun Visit for a Slice of Music History", "We enjoyed visiting the Bowl just to see it as it is the home of many famous concerts. Great vistas as well. We didn't go into the museum as we didn't have time.

Be sure to plan ahead, and enjoy pre event festivities, can take own wine and beer before concert. The only bad thing are the lines once inside the facility they take for ever to purchase food, or drinks buy them before show starts or be prepared to loose at least two or three of your favorite songs in line.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 26, 2016", 5.0, "Excellent Venue", "Been here a few times now and have always been happy with the visit. Good sound and the big screens help with viewing the performers. There is traffic coming and going as would be expected, so planning for it is helpful. Lots of places for picnicking. Would highly recommend if you can fit it in.

The orchestra performed first and was spectacular. Chicago, backed by the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, put on an incredible show. The concert ended with a phenomenal fireworks display with the orchestra playing Sousa marches. The venue allows food and drink to be brought on to the premises. There was ample food and drink available for purchase. The facilities were clean and more than accommodating for the over 10k audience members.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 25, 2016", 5.0, "Great place to see a show!", "This is a wonderful outdoor venue!
