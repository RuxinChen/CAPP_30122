For years I tried to get as close as I could for pictures. Here is the straight dope. You want to drive up the hills from Franklin Ave. Franklin is one block north of Hollywood Blvd. Turn up into the hills from Franklin onto N.Beachwood Dr. this is the street that takes you right up to the trail to get to the sign. Once again you will pass signs that say no access to the Hollywood sign, it's just the locals trying to scare you away.

When I went, there was a very helpful security guard at the gate. You have to park on the neighborhood street. I suggest you get there by 10 am for two reasons. It will be easier to find a parking space and it won't be too hot for the hike. The hike is 1.75 miles to the top.

So here are a few tips on how I managed to see it and get some good shots without going to huge efforts.\n\nFirstly you can\u2019t just drive right up to the sign and hang out under one of the letters. It\u2019s way off in the hills and cordoned off by gates and security. There are walks and trailheads to the sign apparently but these require time and planning (you can get up behind the sign and look down over LA)\n\nI found the best views were from the top Hollywood & Highland mall, and especially from the Griffith Observatory. And the plus here is that the Observatory itself is such a great attraction with amazing views out to LA in the other direction. It\u2019s totally possible to get good selfies from the Observatory with the Hollywood Sign behind you, and let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s what the people\u2019s want!

Yes, it is just a sign but it is a famous sign and many people are doing what you will be doing. Parking is atrocious. Get there earlier for better parking. Or you can park down the hill and walk. This is a very steep hill. My 84 year old Mom had trouble just keeping her balance on the steep sidewalk, but it was worth the trip and the priceless picture.
