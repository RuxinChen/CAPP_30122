But it is a big tourist destination with a fair amount of crime and aggressive sales people pushing their tours or CD's. Went several years ago and the kids enjoyed the wax museum while we looked at all the stars. Took my mom back there last week and she loved seeing all the stars and the Dolby Theatre. Interesting to see them setting up for the Oscars.

Some decent restaurants on the Blvd, and TCL Chinese theater, where they do all the premieres. There's also a mall next door, with standard stores. parking is high in this area, so take Uber. Traffic is always heavy around here though. Good clubs nearby at Hollywood & Highland as well. Pricey. If you take a pic with the people in the costumes, they'll ask for money. There's a main souvenir shop where everything is $5-10, and it's your expected Hollywood souvenir items. Best thing on the Blvd to me is the Foot Locker lol.

There are people dressed like famous movie characters who come up and ask if you want a picture with them and once you pose and take the picture they ask you for money!! 2 guys dressed like Star Wars characters asked us to pose for a photo and we did, using our camera and we took the photo. Then the guys said they normally get $20 per picture!! We said we only had a few dollars with us which was true but he said he would take a credit card. I refused to give them $20 for maybe 2 minutes of their time when I didn\u2019t ask for the picture, they approached us!

Not only to notice the names on the stars or see the various icons for film, music, directors, etc -- but because there are so many people stopped by their favorite celebrity's names having someone take a photo of them, or trying to pose with a selfie stick. Walking and avoiding the posers can be like being a character in an arcade game. (And then you can add in walking around crowds that form around the unofficial movie/cartoon characters and dodging the guys who want you to go to the $5 souvenir store, which is not a good deal or the guys giving your their CDs and then following you for money.)\n\nStarting at La Brea and going eastward for 1.2 miles to N. Gower Street, Hollywood Blvd is dotted with stars. In fact, you can see them on Google Maps when in satellite view.\n\nIf you want to see the area on the map, enter Statue of the Four Ladies of Hollywood for La Brea side (it's on the south side of Hollywood Blvd and is a major landmark) and the Fonda Theater (north side of Hollywood Blvd) for Gower.\n\nNot all the stars have names though. Some are blanks awaiting an icon and name. Some are in a single line while others are staggered side by side.\n\nParking isn't easy around Hollywood Blvd so you may have to park a few blocks south. Or you can pay upwards of $7 a parking lot. If you happen to have a day or multi-day pass for unlimited metro rides, get off at the Hollywood and Highland station or Hollywood and Vine and have a walk. But if you're all the way across LA, bear in mind that a 2-mile drive is 15 minutes if not much more, and this is not that amazingly great. Maybe drive over there after well around rush hours, preferably after 7. Unless there's an event on Hollywood Blvd that night, it's much more doable at night.\n\nAnother reason to be there when it's dark out is that Hollywood Blvd is much more unique and beautiful when it's lit up at night.\n\nThe stars themselves aren't something I'd call spectacular, but the experience of Hollywood Blvd is unique.\n\nYou could walk the entire area in however long it takes you to walk 1.2 miles on a crowded street, but you'll likely want to stroll and take in more of what Hollywood Blvd has to offer so I am writing 2-3 hours for your visit. But you can also pop out of the subway and look at a few stars for 10 minutes and be back on your way.\n\n(I have lived in the area on and off for many years and seen the Walk of Fame many a time under many circumstances at every time of the year.)\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 3 weeks ago", 5.0, "Walking On Stars", "It was very fun walking and looking at all the names on the stars.
