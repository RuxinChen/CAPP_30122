It's all built up in your mind. The place is quite bad and scary for anyone. We arrived around 4 ish. We walked around from the Hollywood Highland metro station but when we reached the world famous Chinese theatre it was closed as a film premiere was happening at 7. We took photos of the street and Hollywood sign walked all the way to where CVS pharmacy was. We then walked the back all the way past the church of Scientology. All we saw was famous people name on the ground and people taking photos of it. We couldn't see the handprints and footprints hollywood as that whole area was shut down for the movie.\n\nThe good: we saw from across the street the premiere of \"game night\" and managed to spot Jason Bateman. We saw the famous names on the street. We walked a bit and went to the Disney chocolate store which is great. The lovely people who dress up as superheros and others who offer you jokes as you wait for the lights to turn, sometimes it feels weird but they mean no harm.\n\nThe bad: there are people trying to sell you all kind of things from tours to t-shirts to their cd albums and so on. We had people come up to us asking us to take a \"free personality test\" which is basically a way to introduce you to the church of Scientology. AVIOD this. The street was not clean and felt dirty even the air around it felt worse than London's \"polluted\" air. Honestly it took the image I had of Hollywood that was in my mind and destroyed it.\n\nThe whole place gives you a bad vibe and you just feel scared even though you are perfectly fine and law enforcement is around so you shouldn't.
