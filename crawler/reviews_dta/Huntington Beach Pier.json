It is located at the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street. The pier receives thousands of visitors every year. It is a sturdy concrete pier that extends well out into the Pacific Ocean. It is not unusual to see multiple fishermen pulling in fish over the rail. There is a restaurant at the end of the Pier which offers an excellent indoor experience which provides views of the coast as it wraps around from Long Beach to the North, to Laguna Beach to the South.\n\nYou have an unobstructed view of the coast of Newport Beach boats exiting the harbor. Full blown luxury yachts motor up and down the coast. Aircraft routinely fly up and down the coast. The beaches are easily in view from Seal Beach to Costa Mesa.\n\nVendors line the pier up to the point that the pier goes over the ocean. Under the pier is a great place to grab some shade. Every year there are functions such as the World Surfing Championships because of the great waves for surfers. On the pier, you have a unique view as if your were out on a boat watching the surfers ride. Life guards protect the beach visitors from everything from rip currents to sting ray stings and medical emergencies.\n\nThe pier is an extension of Main Street out into the ocean. Main Street is in direct line of sight containing restaurants, bars, and shopping opportunities. If you are in Southern California, this is an enjoyable must see location. There is ample parking. But, due to large crowds, it is best to arrive early in the morning, park and enjoy the day. If you have visitors from out of town, this is a great place to go. Every 4th of July Huntington Beach has a parade down Main Street. This is a great event with thousands of people. Much of it can be seen from the pier. There is seating next to the pier which gives views of the surfers. Hang loose.\n\nSurf City, U. S. A.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 3 weeks ago", 4.0, "Very nice place!", "Very nice place.

Of course the surfers are still here, and some of the great surfing competitions in the world are hosted here.\n\nBut, as with so many mythic destinations, most people who come here are those following a guide book.

Without a life these are just words on a page of a guidebook.\n\nDoes this mean you shouldn't visit? No, of course not!! You must come to the beach and walk the pier. You must eat at Ruby's at the end of the pier.\n\nBut you should also spend time watching the people. In amongst the hordes of visitors you will see the locals, or the connected, or the surreal. They are surfers, or walkers, or something designated as 'homeless', or fishers, or walkers. These folk are not visitors, they are intricately part of Huntington Beach. If you ever get the chance introduce yourself. But do this with care and respect. You, the visitor, are standing in their living room, or patio or kitchen and as such, you need to be respectful.\n\nOne day we were there the Blue Angels gave an air display that was quite literally earth-shattering and mind-boggling.

The people walking, running, strolling, sitting, fishing, watching surfers, always present a new experience. The shops and restaurants are space to keep the pier feeling wide open. As you go out you just see the ocean, Catalina, Long Beach and Newport, but as you return you see the varied skyline of HB and the mountains behind. We use it as a must with visitors, after breakfast at Sugar Shake in the morning and with ice cream from BR or a gelato shop on Main St. Parking is easy... great fun and FREE!!!!!!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 8, 2017", 4.0, "Pier", "This can be cold/warm/windy in the winter, can be hit and miss with weather.\nThere are always lots of people fishing at the end of the pier.\nIt's a great place to see seals- seen many each night while walking around .\n\nNo skateboards on the walkway\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 7, 2017", 4.0, "Sunday afternoon stroll on the pier", "It was a very crowded 'major surfing event' day, but still we had lots of good viewing of the surfers from the pier.
