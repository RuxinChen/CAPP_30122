We thoroughly enjoyed exploring all of them. Here are some tips. Remember to take plenty of water and sunblock. There is a reasonable entrance fee. Check the website for up to date information.\n1. Murray Canyon trails and Andreas Canyon trails are both accessible from the same parking lot. There are picnic tables near the lot. The trails are posted on a board where you can view length and difficulty. If you have limited time, I suggest taking the Andreas Canyon trail. Enter off of the main parking area, do not cross the stream, look for the Andreas Canyon sign and veer left. Within minutes you are transported to a desert oasis. If you are not a hiker, just five minutes on this path will give you wonderful sights. This is a loop trail. It is about a mile, and although it is marked easy, it is rocky and has some elevation changes. There is a good deal of shade the entire way.\n2. Palm Canyon is about two miles away along a well marked road from the other canyons. There are bathrooms, a gift store and a very limited snack bar. I advise bringing your own food. The hikes from this spot are much longer in duration. However, by the concession stand there is a path to a grove of palm trees and a stream where there are picnic tables. It is a switch back trail and is not nearly as steep as it looks. It would be a great place for lunch. One word of warning, if you have a RV or similar vehicle, you will not be able to drive all the way to the parking lot at Palm Canyon. There is a boulder passage that is narrow. You will have to park below the main lot and hike uphill from it for about an eight of a mile.\nEnjoy you day!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 6 days ago", 5.0, "Breathtaking.

The second half is through the desert. The contrast is quite extreme.\nThe signage is not good and the path at the desert end of the hike not well defined.
