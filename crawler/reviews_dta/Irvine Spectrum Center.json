In-seat food & bar service are awesome!\nWhile shopping is probably not the biggest draw of this center, the people-watching, unique kiosks, and general entertainment are. From The huge Ferris Wheel, beautiful Carosel, Dave & Busters, virtual reality gaming/racing, to the \u201cHello Kitty\u201d pop-up, this center can be eye-popping. And, outdoor ice skating in the winter months with plentiful seating to sit back and take it all in.\nThere is an abundance of eating options as well. From affordable to impressive, it\u2019s good for little kiddos, multi-family meals, first date impressions, and power lunches. My new fave place is \u201cHabana\u201d, retro Cuban to the core but, So Cal in its wow factor.\n\nGreat for young families & and moms with strollers. Lots to see, and play. Bubble fountains, trains, ice cream, and lots of walking\n\nCons: really crowded week-end evenings (not an issue during the day), don\u2019t expect to pop-in for a quick meal after 5:00. Every place is packed. If you\u2019re not accustomed to a variety of cultures this may not be a comfortable place for you, especially Friday nights. I personally love it but, I know some people are put-off.\nWhile there is a vast abundance of parking lots & spaces it still can take time & patience to find a spot, rest assured: you will.\nLots of new construction for additional experiences, don\u2019t let that keep you away. It\u2019s all neatly organized and hidden. Irvine Company does everything possible to ensure their properties are always stellar, ahead of any and all competition.\nOne last note: this is a wildly confusing center logistically. Keep your eye on the directories & maps to figure out where you are and where you\u2019re going.

I remember there used to be a Medieval Times store, a Love Sac store, and a magician store filled with quirky items like puppets and the like all in the same court. There was more space for parking before, but now that's been filled in with new businesses, which makes things a bit more congested and bottle-necked. The Macy's as well has since been demolished and smaller stores will fill in the void. The Improv Comedy Club is still here, but was moved to a spot near the movie theater. The old space has been replaced with a Kona Grill (which I might check out one of these days).\n\nThe movie theater is fantastic and has a lot of screens for new movies, including IMAX where I remember seeing Batman Returns, The Lion King, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Interstellar (in 70 mm.). The prices are a bit expensive but I'm a Regal Club member which allows me to get free movie tickets sometimes (I've seen Wolf of Wall Street and Thor: Ragnorak at this theater for free). There is a Dave and Busters, Target, Barnes and Noble, Apple (where I bought the MacBook Air that I'm writing this review with) and other stores, along with multiple restaurants like Subway, The Yard House, Red Robin, Chipotle, Ruby's, CPK and more. The architecture is really nice and timeless, reflecting the region's Spanish heritage while also throwing in some Moorish/Islamic elements similar to the Alhambra. They also have a ferris wheel and carousel and while I've never been on either they both make this place more family friendly and help Irvine Spectrum stand out from other malls and shopping centers. One of the quirky newer additions I like is The Ride 7D, which operates like Star Tours at Disneyland only you shoot at things on the screen.\n\nI have to be honest, this is practically a second home for me. I see people from all ethnicities and backgrounds walking around me which helps make this place so vibrant and full of life. It has the right amount of high-end shops and middle-class fare that appeals to the whole spectrum (no pun intended) and brings everybody in.

It is clean, secure, well-lit, and there is ample parking. I feel very comfortable dropping off my teenage child with friends here on a Saturday night.\n\nYou will find a large movie theater (with 21 Theaters inside), and tons of restaurants. There's also a Dave & Buster's, as well as a merry-go-round, a ferris wheel, and various game venues. For example, there's a 3D ride, and in the winter time there is an actual ice skating ring!\n\nThere's also tons of shopping, with everything from Target to Macy's to Nordstrom's, as well as small boutiques. The restaurant options are unparalleled, you can go budget at Subway to upscale at PF Changs, with everything in between.\n\nThis mall is a great first step for younger teens wanting to spread their wings, in my humble opinion. Parents can enjoy an upscale dinner while kids hang out at the movies or shopping. The mall is so big, you probably won't run into each other, but you'll be close enough in case they need you.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed March 2, 2017", 5.0, "Spectacular Shopping Center", "Very beautiful place to shop, stroll, have fun with your family.
