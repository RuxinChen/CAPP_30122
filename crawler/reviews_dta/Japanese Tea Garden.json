The garden layout is beautiful with an enchanting view with every twist and turn on the winding paths. Some of the pagodas are clearly in need of maintenance - you can see the peeling paint and fading colors. The gift shop and the tea shop by the pond were delightful (albeit expensive) as well.

She told me the history of the original owner and it had made me feel so sad. But the beauty of this garden is overwhelming. Each part is carefully designed and well kept. It is very quiet in the garden. I could have taken a book and sat under a tree all day.\nThere is a place to get tea at the end of the trail, but I did not want any. There are also bathrooms. I would think if you had small children, this is not the place to view it as a jungle gym. It is a place of some very old pieces.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 9, 2017", 5.0, "Plants, Ponds and Japanese Architecture", "This Japanese garden is a beautiful horticulture gem in Golden Gate Park.

It is full of beautiful plants, features and ponds with little bridges and stepping stones. Large carp swin in the ponds which are lovely to watch.\n\nOnly negatives are: it's quite a small area and the $9 price tag seems a bit steep. However, it's free between 9.00-10.00 am (check if that's only certain days). Also, it gets extremely busy - so going early would probably solve this. Another side more: toilets aren't great. Much better to visit the toilets near the bowling green area - loads of well looked after cubicles (lol).\n\nBut I think most people who enjoy looking around gardens will enjoy this one.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 6, 2017", 4.0, "Go early or late or on a weekday", "Loved it. So many interesting features. I went when it rained and it was beautiful and most of the people went to the teahouse so I had a lot of the garden to myself. It got crowded once it stopped raining - this was on a Friday in August. Probably not so busy a at the start of the day or end and not during the height of tourist season.
