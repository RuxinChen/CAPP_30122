The park charges $8.00 per box (bundle), and the wood is very light in density. There is a gas station outside the park that sells firewood.\n\nWe stayed in site # 77 which was great. It is a large site, and very secluded even though we had neighbors. I posted some pictures to give you an idea.\n\nThe campground hosts were not very helpful or friendly.

The canopy is so full and it is so enclosed you feel like you are on a different planet. We even found a trail to the pristine Smith River.
