They are rebuilding the bridge, it will be completed in late September or early October.\nSo access is denied from the north.\nAs of this writing - July 2017 - there are still mud and rock slides to the south of there. So access is denied from the south.\nMud and rock slides??\nIt's not raining, hasn't rained in months.\nLet me explain.\nThe late winter rains were so intense, that the slides were so bad, they are still trying to get them cleared.\nAt the extreme south end, 50 miles south of the being rebuilt bridge, is a rock slide so large, it's the biggest, in the over 40 years I have lived on the coast. That slide alone added 16 acres of new coastline to Big Sur.\nBecause the ocean all along Big Sur is a National Marine Sanctuary, the can't push any material over the edge.\nIt all has to scooped up and put into dump trucks, and hauled away. For the largest rock slide in recent history, that's a tall order, not to mention an enormous expense.\nThere are estimating it will take a year to get the highway open on the south end.\nSo plan on visiting the park, after it opens, after the bridge is rebuilt.

The 1,522 Hectare (3,762 acres) park was named after Julia Pfeiffer Burns (1868-1928), a local and legendary early pioneer woman and resident of Big Sur. The McWay Falls, McWay Creek and McWay Canyon are named after Christopher McWay, an early settler and farmer from New York State who arrived in the area with his son Christopher Jr. around 1874. The park extends from the Big Sur coastline to the nearby 915 m (3,000 ft) ridge.\n\nWe drove from the south to this amazing California state park. We were lucky to find free roadside parking along the west side of Highway 1. We went across the street and followed the sign to the official parking lot which led us to a tunnel under the highway. After the short tunnel, we turned right and followed the trail to the McWay Waterfall House. The 107 m (352 ft) long trail is right on the edge of the cliff and offers a magnificent view of the McWay Canyon, McWay Cove, McWay Beach and the McWay Falls. Most of the visitors like us brought out cameras and took photos. We could see the beach and the cove below, surrounded by ridges. Before 1983, the beach was non-existent and the falls fell directly to the ocean below. The 1983 huge rainfall resulted in several landslides and mudflows. The mudflow entered the ocean immediately to the north of the falls, creating the beach we see today. In few minutes, we saw the famous McWay Falls right in front of us. The 24 m (80 ft) waterfall seemed small from where we stood because the trail is higher up than the top of the falls. The water flow was not huge and significant, but it is one of two waterfalls in California that cascade directly into the ocean, the other being Alamere Falls. At the end of trail, we saw the Waterfall House that was the house of Lathrop and Helene Brown. Later in 1961, Helene Hooper Brown donated the entire property to the state. The mansion was demolished in 1966.\n\nIt is sad to learn that Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park is closed and not accessible from both sides of Highway 1 due to road closures, rock slides and dangerous conditions.

If you like to hike, this is an absolute must see. We parked in the $10 lot, did the short walk to see the falls, and then hiked the Edwolson trail. We are an experienced group of hikers from the Bay area. We've seen steep climbs and beautiful vistas. This hike included both and was very impressive. It's not easy. The trail has a large elevation gain and some of it is narrow. It'scompletely worth it, though!. First you hike through beautiful woods with serene waterfalls .Then you reach the top with ocean views in abundance. Bring plenty of water and a camera. Other tips: Go counterclockwise around the loop so you are uphill in shade. Take the \"Waters?\" (Can't really remember name) off shoot trail about 2.5 miles into the loop.
