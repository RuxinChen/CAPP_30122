Not so at Knott\u2019s Berry. Admittedly it is winter but the wait times were usually no more than 15mins maybe 20mins at a stretch even for the popular rides. And what awesome rides. The Silver Bullet is fast and twists and turns all over the place, there were a number of smaller roller coasters that at first looked a bit lame but were actually great like the spinning tea cups. Log ride was great and the fear fall (not sure what it was called but you get dropped from a great height) was positively a rush. But the real gem was the ghost rider a wooden roller coaster that just kept on going on forever and it is really fast.\nGreat day and would highly recommend if you like lots of adrenaline rush type rides.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 1 week ago", 4.0, "Season pass! Convenient, nice day out, roosters in the parking lot", "The season pass is so affordable! We usually walk the park and just hang out for a while. Neither of us (hubby or I) are much interested in the big rides, but we have a good time walking around. What's unique is that Knott's still has \"craftspersons\" who show their craft--glass blowing, sketching, sewing, etc. I like Knott's because I don't get the big-park merchandising push that I feel with other local LARGE theme parks. Huge? no. Positioned to sell merchandise? no. It's more of a local So Cal thing I guess. There are even roosters in the parking lot (no lie)!! And a saloon where you can buy a beer (I'm sure overpriced). On the outside of the park, there's a bar if that's what you're looking for.\n\nBerries are the big deal here.

The lines are usually much, much shorter than Disneyland, which is only 6 miles away. One can buy a season pass into this park for cheaper than one day in Disneyland, although TIP: heavier guests will find some rides not accommodating. Disneyland has more accomodations for heavy guests.\n\nTIP: Get season passes. Season passes can also give discounts\nTIP: Consider food passes/drink passes\nTIP: If you stay at the Knott's hotel, then parking is free.\n\nDISABILITY:\nThere are wheelchairs and electric mobility scooters for rent in the park. Disabled guests should go to guest services to get a blue card to allow for use of disabled entrances into the rides. This is not always a line cut. They will give you a time to come back on busy rides. The stagecoach ride is not ADA compliant (nor is it required to be as it is a historic ride) but doable if you can transfer, although you cannot ride on the outside unless you can handle climbing a bit.\n\nTIP: If you tell them that you have spinal issues, they will give you a red card and deny your ability to access most rides. So use your best judgement on your own capabilities and ride at your own risk.\n\nTIP: If you bring your own chair and it breaks (and mine did through no fault of the park), there is a medical durable equipment store nearby.\n\nKNOTT'S SCARY FARM (month of October): This requires separate admission even with a season pass. There are a number of haunted houses open within the park and scarers have been added to the log ride. The park is pumped with fog in areas and there are costumed monsters/zombies/psycho clowns etc throughout the park. It is aimed at 13 and older. Most of the rides are open. Camp Snoopy is closed but does have scarers there. There on monsters on stilts. Monsters with metal knee pads and and scraping of snow shovel style sounds. The monsters are somewhat themed too. The ghost town has cowboy ghosts. The Mexico area has some more that are like \"Day of the Dead\" style. The boardwalk has psycho clowns (so for those of you afraid of clowns you may want to stay away). Zombies are generally roaming. If you run, THEY WILL CHASE YOU. If you don't run, THEY MAY GET CLOSE BUT THEY WON'T TOUCH YOU. TIP: Some of the shows have adult humor. You can preview them on youtube.\n\nTIP: DON'T RUN. If you scare or startle easily, tell yourself not to run.\n\nOur son is 7. He can be a bit of a chicken. I was desperate to see Elvira Mistress of the Dark's last show at Knott's Scary Farm but were afraid to take our son through the park. (BTW, you can watch most of her appearances at Knott's on youtube). So, we decided to have him ride on my lap (I am in a wheelchair). We armed him with a Knott's pop cork gun. We did not take him into any of the haunted houses. However, we did do the log ride with scarers and did brave the park in general. HE HAD A BLAST! Literally... He sat on my lap and blasted monsters left and right with his cork gun. They all played along. He would shoot them and they would pretend to fall. He did this all over the park. It was like a shooting gallery. He fired and fired and even a couple of them did manage to sneak up on us (yes, i was helping him call targets). However by the time someone actually got close enough to scare him, he already felt empowered enough to merely turn and shoot them. The only problem came was that we stopped to eat on the boardwalk. The psycho clowns thought my son was cute. He was not afraid of their bloody knives, axes, or anything. Then, he was flirting with a couple of the female psycho clowns. One was going to make him a balloon animal. I did not see that coming. My son has a balloon phobia. He freaked out and took off running. We had to catch him and bring him back. Axes, chainsaws, swords, zombies, ghouls, murderers... none scared him.... but a balloon animal sent him running in terror.. The gals felt bad because he is so little... He was fine again once the balloons were gone. BTW even on the log ride, he blasted all the monsters and werewolves. So my recommendation, KNOW YOUR CHILD... EMPOWER THEM... They may surprise you. I would also say that he felt safer on my lap over if we had just been initially walking. KEEP YOUR HAND ON YOUR CHILD... so if they do get scared, they don't bolt into the darkness/crowds... Review the show videos on youtube for sample content before you take your kids to \"The Hanging.\" The most scary and violent content can be avoided by staying out of the haunted houses so switch off parents if you think your kids cannot handle the haunted houses. It also helps to know if your child knows the difference between fantasy and reality. Ours does and ultimately knew the roaming monsters were just people having fun in costumes. IT IS RECOMMENDED FOR 13+... It is not worth traumatizing your child. So, have a back up plan. We had noise cancelling headphones and a blanket for him to hide under if we found that he could not handle the roamers. We ended up not needing them (as I said, I was desperate to see Elvira, as was my husband). Otherwise, I would not have exposed my son at all. However now that we have gone, I know that, outside of balloons, he would be okay.\n\nTIP: ONLY PARK EMPLOYEES MAY WEAR COSTUMES.. my son did have a transformer jacket on though (not really a costume).\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 3 weeks ago", 5.0, "This is the place to go in SoCal", "If you have kids young or old this is the place to go.

There is a variety of small kids to adult attractions. Good shopping and food at the park also. It's much cheaper then other parks like it in the area and the annual pass is well worth it.

The crowds are apparently much more sparse during the week (which is when we went) and more full on weekends. We had very little wait in most lines throughout the day, however, I felt there really weren't many rides here to enjoy for the price paid. I have been to Disneyland, Disneyworld, Cedar Point, and Magic Mountain and I would say all of them have way more to see, do, and ride than Knott's does. I was really disappointed with the lack of entertainment options while there.\n\nOn to the positives, if you want to get a good bite to eat and get some great fudge and sweet treats this is a great place for that! On the way into the park we stopped at a few of the shops and got some treats (honestly, we got some treats afterword too) and the salt water taffy I got was the best I've ever had! The food inside the park is pretty good as well-and a good bargain too if you get the All Day Dining Pass for $31.99 (we split the meals between 2 of us, so each to got many small meals all day long) since you can get a meal every 90 minutes. To compare, if you were to buy 2 meals in the park it would cost you about the same price as the All Day Dining Pass-so as long as you eat at least 3 meals with your pass while there you will have saved yourself some real money.

The point of the review is to say that when I called to see about having our expenses refunded due to our inability to attend as planned, the customer service person with whom we spoke was amazing. Knott's made a full refund to us, with no hassle or penalty at all. Nowadays, sadly, it is rare to have such accommodating service. It was so refreshing to have such service, that I felt it was important to make it known on Tripadvisor. We look forward to having the chance to have another visit as soon as possible.

It was the local hot spot for teens. It was where I had my first date and where I met my wife on a blind date in 1997. I've had the pleasure of watching Knott's change over the years, I'll explain more below. At a fraction of the cost to visit local rival Disneyland, Knott's still offers a more-affordable entertainment option than Disney with enough rides, shows, and attractions to fill an entire day.\n\nIf you've been to Knott's before 2009 but not after the Cedar Fair purchase, he's what you'll miss: Berry Tails are completely gone. They had moved them from the Kingdom of the Dinosaurs attraction to a fun house in Camp Snoopy, but now the cute critters we knew and loved have been sold in auction. Dolphin water shows have been gone for years, and the overall makeup of what gave the park personality have been replaced with thrill rides, such as extreme roller coasters and spinning carnival rides.\n\nFortunately, Ghost Town has not changed much. Even as recently as 2016, Knott's has introduced an annual Ghost Town event that brings in crowds who want to see cowboys and robberies and the Old West at it's finest.\n\nCamp Snoopy has also been updated with new kids rides, most of which you'll find at your local carnival or festival, but fun nonetheless. The charm of Camp Snoopy left with the closure of the famous fun house, skywalk and bounce house. However, the show has not been removed and does actually get better each year.\n\nFiesta Village hasn't changed much, despite the attempts to bring in new innovative rides that failed. I do miss having a Corona at the restaurant by the lake. That's gone and with it a favorite occasional pastime.\n\nI also miss the Haunted Shack, fortunately the original is still around up-state, as is a small version of it in Calico, CA. In it's place, a stage and occasional shows (mostly during summer and Halloween Haunt).\n\nHalloween Haunt is always a sellout, it's been said that Haunt pays for the park to stay open the rest of the year, yah, it's that big of a deal. You need to buy tickets early and now that they offer season passes for Haunt, the crowds are worse than ever. Be prepared for 1-2 hour waits on mazes, and since they only have a certain number of mazes, better plan for 3 nights at the park if you want to see them all.\n\nPrices are outrageous, but hey it's a theme park, it's what you expect. Pack a lunch or eat at one of the lower-cost restaurants in the back of the park. Bring plenty of water.\n\nDon't miss the Stagecoach ride or the show at the entrance to the park. Check the show schedule for special events happening at the Charles M. Schulz Theatre, such as Snoopy on Ice during the holidays and Elvira during Haunt (though I heard 2017 might have been her last year).\n\nYou'll have fun no matter what.

Random coasters, super hero merchandise and the odd old west curio are all slammed together - nothing really makes any sense theme wise.\n\nThe crowds were our biggest complaint. We actually stumbled across a long-time park employee/friend who told us many more families came here now because Disneyland is so expensive (which it is). Lines for most rides were hours long, and unlike Disneyland there is no signage telling you expected wait times, or even where the line for a specific attraction starts! In 8 hours we were only able to get on 3 rides. Trash was another issue, in many ride queues trash was overflowing from cans or just strewn about (Iron Reef was especially bad).\n\nWe also learned the new owners of Knotts Berry Farm, Cedar Fair, allocated (read stole) the Knotts employees' Christmas bonus this year (and seemingly in the past as well) to help pay for other parks they run across the country. Really lame.\n\nThe rides we did get on were fun (Ghostrider was especially thrilling) - though some new needed a little TLC (the log ride was great but its showing its age and it runs so fast through the dark areas you almost miss the interior scenes entirely).\n\nKnotts wants to be the Disney alternative, but it needs to step up its game - especially when it comes to theme/vision and service.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 4, 2018", 5.0, "Excellent Alternative to Disney!", "We were pleasantly surprised by this theme park.

They give actual horse-drawn stagecoach rides, and you can go for a short ride on their full-size, narrow-gauge steam locomotive (complete with robbers who \"rob\" the train enroute). The park is populated with authentic craftsmen/women (such as blacksmiths, wood craftsmen, glass blowers, etc) who make genuine products that you can then purchase and take home after watching them make it in front of you.\n\nThe park is largely \"Wild West\" themed, and they play it to good effect. Cast members remain in character and have wonderful improvisational talents. If rides aren't your thing, they have a large variety of shows to watch during the day as well. If you're a Halloween fan, a visit during the Halloween season for \"Knott's Scary Farm\" is a must. It is a remarkable Halloween event filled with spooky shows, haunted houses, scare zones and rides in the dark. Knott's Merry Farm is their Christmas event, and the park is beautifully decorated to celebrate the Christmas holiday, along with a large variety of lights (they could definitely increase the amount of lights they string up during Merry Farm though).\n\nIt's not Disney.

It was part of out Go L.A. pass, so it was included along with 35+ other places, so why not?\n\nWe have been to other parks owned by \"Cedarefare\" as I think they own almost all of the major parks now, so we kind of knew what to expect. The one thing that was really different about this park is, it's all set up like a small town out of the old west. From the time you are walking in from the parking lot, until you get to the back of the park, it is like you are walking through an old west town with coasters and such. Another thing we liked was, they had some different type of coasters we had never seen before. A good example of this is the horses, the name of the ride escapes me, however it is where you sit on a horse similar to those old dime store rides as a kid and ride it like a coaster.\n\nThe unfortunate thing about pretty much every Cedarfare property is lack of healthy food options. A few things of fruit on carts or a ceasar salad is not really balancing out the scale. Most of their food options at any of the parks are the same burgers, dogs, pizza. I was not looking for absolute crazy health freak, but there was almost nothing. We asked several staff/cast members whatever and none had any suggestions. We look at most of the places ourselves as well.\n\nThat said, this is another one of those two parks for price of one, or two parks one great price. Which is really the best value if you had kids. The park is not that large, and they only have a handful of adult rides. You would want to do the water park to make a full day of it. That is, unless there are crazy lines where you are waiting an hour each time for rides.\n\nAll in all, this was a good experience.

The one thing I will note to anyone looking to do this though, if you do get a Go LA pass, make sure you go to the ticket booth BEFORE you get in line.

First I have to say the decorations and the mazes were much better in quality than they used to be years ago, it is now very impressive. I was a little disappointed that they barely decorated to Log Ride and that they no longer decorate the Mine Ride. Years ago the individual shops and restaurants also were decorated by the employees and that was always fun to see but that was stopped many years ago. I was absolutely shocked how much they charge for food, $12.69 for a hot dog and French fries and also saw a funnel cakes for $9.99 and up. Honestly it the prices were too high and all the fast food restaurants were dead with no business or lines at all for the entire evening even though the park was filled with people. Years ago you had to wait quite a while in line for any food or drinks. I believe if the prices were much lower they would have a lot more sales. The haunted mazes were very good and I had a great time but I just refuse to pay that much for junk food.

The regular park closes at 5pm and the Knotts Scary Farm runs from 7pm-2am through Halloween. Ticket prices increase as it gets closer to Halloween. I paid approximately $42 through gold star. You must make reservations for specific nights online. Or you can pay at the park but they can be at capacity. Tickets are inexpensive but parking is $20 for regular and $30 for preferred. The nice thing is it wasn't too far of walk for the $20 parking. I didn't notice a shuttle option either.\n\nThe price was ok, ok enough that I didn't have to worry about losing too much money if I got scared and decided to go home early. Note, no re-entry to the park. Luckily everything was ok and I had a good time.\n\nLines can range from 30 mins to 1hr + for some of the mazes. If you are willing to pay you should invest in the fright lane (aka fast lane). It's more likely that you'll see everything at the park. During our 5 hour visit we completed 3 mazes, 2 rides and watched the Elvira show. That was good enough for me.\n\nI recommend getting there 30 minutes before the park opens and tackling the most popular mazes first. Infected (where you laser tag zombies) and Dark Ride (clown theme) appeared to have the longest lines. I would make time to see the Elvira show too. It's only 30 minutes. I would pass on the Hangtime show which was awful and all politically driven. This show is outdoors with standing room only.\n\nOverall this was a one time only experience for me and while nerve wrecking at some points it was bearable because I had a partner to guide me through the mazes. The monsters in costume roam the park to terrorize guests as well but they are more centralized in specific areas.

KBF has also added many more attractions and performances which was a nice surprise. Still love to see the western theme alive with employees dressed as long ago times of past. We took my son here for the first time as we now live in Asia. He really enjoyed interacting with most of the employees and experiencing their characters and the stories they shared. Park was well kept up and clean and not overcrowded on most of the rides. The Wild West show was still as I remembered it as a boy and my son who had his ears covered the whole show, enjoyed it as well.\n\nThe gal who was working in the pony express office that day was wonderful and her and my son got along great as she sent him around the park on many special errands. Turns out she lived where we did in Asia for a while so we had a good laugh sharing stories. Small world.\n\nWhere KBF lost a rating was because of a few unpleasant experiences we had there. The first was our encounter with the sheriff on duty that day. When others sent my son to him to deliver messages, he appeared to see this as an annoyance more than part of his job. This left a bad taste in our mouths as my son was very excited to do this and the response he got from this guy was less than friendly. Apparently having to take time away from him talking to the same two other employees we saw him chatting with throughout the day, was annoying to him so he quickly did what he had to do to shoo my son away.\n\nThe next downside was having to wait over 30 minutes after waiting in a line for 15 minutes to get our food? Poorly understaffed and mismanaged as there were only about 15 people in line at the time though it felt like there were hundreds ordering.

The really irritating thing was that many of the 6 person rafts only contained 2 people.

I expect to pay something extra for something nice, but this is expensive without really delivering anything memorable.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 17, 2017", 3.0, "OK Not Great", "Waited in line for over 35 minutes to ride Ghost Rider and finally left as it wasn't moving.

The only problem is that we couldn't afford the $60.00 each for front of line tickets and they didn't get as many rides as they wanted.

On line booking was good. Signs to get there not good but when we got into the park we were initally optimistic. One of the bigame rides was not operating and none of the food outlets opened till 11 am so we could not get breakfast. We did what we wanted and saw what we wacted.

We booked tickets through Expedia before leaving the UK for half the price of gate prices. It was worth every penny. The rides were fantastic and my 2 teenagers had a fab day. The queues for some of the bigger rides were approximately 1 hour but overall waiting time was good - 15mins - 1 hour. The only disappointed was one of the major rides was closed. Food on site was reasonable and we got 2 refillable bottles which were well worth the money if you stay for a full day. I would highly recommend this theme park with teenagers. We chose this over Disneyland as so much cheaper and teenagers no longer into 'Mickey Mouse'.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 11, 2017", 2.0, "A Hot Mess", "Firstly, this park is HOT and there is very little shade to be found. I found at Universal Orlando they shaded entire lines whereas here you roasted in their extremely slow moving lines. Secondly, their organization is also a mess. This had to be one of the most inefficient parks I've been to. Where Disney and Univerisal move things along as fast as possible this place doesn't seem to have any motivation to move lines along. Only one cart is ever going at a time. Also there were 2 rides that were closed all day and 2 rides that were open but then broke down more than once. You may find enough to do here they do have a variety of rides, but you get what you pay for. The shows that I watched were pretty lame definitely not like Disney or Universal. P.s. if you do decide to go here, get the discount coupons at Carl's Jr. The coupon saves you 25 to 30 dollars!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 11, 2017", 2.0, "Not at all impressed", "Let me start off by saying that if I had to find one positive thing about this park it would be the theming. They did that pretty well. It's all downhill from here.\n\nConsidering there are three major theme parks in the area, I expected this park to at least try to act as some healthy competition. First, parking was a disaster. The parking lot is about the size of a large shopping mall. Not nearly what I would have expected for an amusement park of this size.\n\nI was happy to see no line at all to enter the park. It was a hot day. I quickly made my way to the Sierra Sidewinder. This park seems to provide very little shaded area for riders while waiting in line. While that's bad enough, I'm not sure I've ever been in a park that has slower ride operators in terms of loading and unloading. I'm all for safety, but I'm not saying they were being particulary safe, they were just SLOW. I'm a season passholder at Six Flags (New Jersey) and have visited there about 15 times in the last year. I have also been to many other theme parks in my lifetime, including Universal and Disneyland in the last week and Dorney Park and Hersherypark in the last year. Knotts has by far the slowest ride operators I've ever encountered (read ahead).\n\nAfter riding the Sierra Sidewinder, which is a decent ride, we made our way over to the Xcelerator, which was closed. Now, it would have been nice to know that before I paid $18 to park or before I entered the park.\n\nMy husband and daughter then went to ride the Coast Rider, what appeared to have a relatively short wait but was also operated painfully slow for no apparent reason.\n\nWhile they waited for way longer than they should have, my other daughter and I grabbed a drink and sat at a table across from the soccer style carnival game near Xcelerator. We watched as the employee operating that game grew increasingly frustrated as he requested a battery for his microphone pack from the other employee(s)/his boss (golf shirt?) operating the adjacent game but did not receive one. He also made several comments to guests in the microphone that he \"only had two balls left\" and that they were \"the best he had\". I could tell by what he was saying that participants in the game were complaining about the soccer balls. The game operator was being quite rude to participants telling them the balls were \"just fine\" and that they were \"blown up enough\". Instead of using the automatic launcher to roll the balls to participants, the operator was rolling the balls to participants himself. He was rolling them very fast and with a bounce. People were complaining about the delivery and rightfully so. He kept interrupting people as they spoke, laughing off their complaints, and being generally dismissive. One man got so angry that on his last turn, he lost his cool and kicked the ball over the fence behind the soccer backstop. Now, not cool, but the game operator was being very rude and not in a joking/heckling way. But here's the worst part...the game operator says...IN THE MICROPHONE....\"eff off\" to the guy as he's walking away...as the game operator's boss is standing right there! Unbelievable!\n\nAs soon as the \"boss\" retrieved the ball that had been kicked, he also \"found\" a whole stash of brand new balls that were now being launched from the automatic launcher. Of the four people I watched play with the brand new balls, while I was still waiting for my husband and daughter, three out of four walked away as winners. Totally unfair to all of the people that had to kick the old balls that were \"pitched\" by the game operator...all of whom walked away as losers.\n\nAs soon as my husband and daughter came off of the ride we left the park. It's bad enough that the game operator acted inappropriately, but the fact that his boss condoned his behavior is completely unacceptable.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 11, 2017", 5.0, "Loved the Ghost Town Alive show", "I remember going to Knott's Berry Farm as a kid and thinking it was neat, but not great. I went back recently and wow, have things changed for the better! We spent about six out of the seven hours we were in the park watching the wild west stunt show (which was awesome), the train bandits (which was pretty much the opposite of awesome) and the entire drama unfolding all day through little staged events in the Ghost Town (which was tons of fun!). Being involved with the little town of Calico was just adorable, watching the gang try to reclaim the rights to the town and the Sheriff working to keep order, and all the little \"side missions\" you could do just made the whole experience so much better than just a series of pat, staged shows. I look forward to coming back again and again if they keep improving like this.\nShow less"]]}}
