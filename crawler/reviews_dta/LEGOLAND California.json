We spend time building together, watching the movies, and it really is bonding time for us. Our son desperately wanted to visit Legoland and since we would be in the area we decided to make the trip. Firstly, adults cost more. I will never understand this reasoning when the park is geared toward children, most of whom can\u2019t do much in the park without supervision. Then there\u2019s the outrageous cost of food and you get very little of it. There\u2019s also carnival type \u201ctry your chance to win the prize\u201d that every adult knows is set up so you can\u2019t win, but your child begs to do. So there\u2019s $20 for a lot of nothing. Aquarium and water park also cost extra than the park ticket.Lastly, the place is utterly neglected maintenance wise. Just horrible, it was honestly depressing. I\u2019ve been to Disney many times in my life and have never seen this level of poor upkeep at their parks, and I don\u2019t know why, but I expected the same from Legoland. We should have gone to Disney really. I\u2019m aware Lego outsourced these parks to another company and I think they\u2019re doing the brand a huge disservice. A total rip off.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 3 days ago", 3.0, "Definitely fun for the kiddos.", "I have to be honest, for me this place was just meh. I did like the food and they have excellent coffee. I will say I am basing this review from my daughter's perspective. She loved it! She is four years old and was able to go on her first roller coaster. There are so many rides for kids her size that are more than just your kiddie rides so I appreciated that. She loved it! I would say this is not a place to go with your teens, this is a place for lego enthusiasts and little kids. Would I go back? Maybe at least one more time. The parking is ridiculously expensive. I was pretty irked about that for sure. Half of the park looks pretty cool and the other half looks kind of run down. It's no Disneyland, that's for sure, but I recommend it.

The small children will enjoy the games and can ride most of the rides. The kids will have plenty to see and do. They will be tired too if your lucky. The rides were not great, but sufficient. The wait times degrade my experience. Some rides with a 45 plus minute wait. You can get a reservation pass and how much you want to pay determines your wait. Up to $100 per person and you skip most of the waits. This would be well worth it if you are short on time and there is a crowd.

Our total costs for 2 adults and a 7 year old child amounted to $408 Canadian dollars which we found to be very expensive. We never did go back for the second day and it is hard to do everything and the aquarium in one day.\n\nWe found that Legoland was a very poor value, as 1/3 to \u00bd of the park/rides were closed. The water park areas close until March, and a new ride coming in for summer closed another section of the park, and several other rides were also closed for maintenance.\n\nThe only good thing was that the park was not busy at all and lines were no more than 10-12 minutes with many walk up and get on. Do not waste your money paying for the Reserve N Ride not even for the 25% increase in time as most of these quicker lines were closed as there were so few lines.\n\nFood was expensive like you would expect, and most carnival games were ones that are very difficult to win. We found the place to be an overrated cheap corner store carnival that was very expensive. No need to pay for the VIP parking as the regular parking gets you almost in the same space.\n\nWe also pre-purchased the $25 photos which was also not a good value.\nThere are many other choices to go to in the San Diego area, and I would recommend choosing them over Legoland.

There is a nice variety of kinds of thing to do, and usually the lines are not too long (half hour max), so the ratio of time spent having fun vs waiting is quite good.

The water parks were also closed but perhaps they are seasonal. One of the Lego characters on an escalator in Miniland USA was missing a head while many of the older models of buildings in Miniland USA looked dirty and in need of a soapy spray wash.\nThat being said the Las Vegas and New York City building models were well done.\n\nMost of the ride operators looked miserable except for the operators of the Coastersaurus who were exceptionally enthusiastic.\n\nA female operator of the Kid Power Tower ride, who I will not name here, was very unprofessional. Our tweens were on the ride for the first time, loaded themselves, seatbelts etc., but when the ride started their seat did not raise like the others. We got the attention of the ride operator to ask her why they weren\u2019t moving and she said \u2018because they had pushed the black button next to their seat\u2019. The button in question is very nondescript and I might have been apt to push it too as there was no signage saying \u2018don\u2019t press the button\u2019.

Very good food choices", "Our family (mom, dad, two boys 9 and 7) visited LegLand California December 27-30, 2017, and stayed in the LegoLand, California Hotel (also reviewed).\n\nWe arrived to the hotel just before park opening time, and had our luggage stored until check-in, and having arranged to meet with several other families, also with young children. Our park admission was included in our hotel package, but admission was about $80 per person for the entire day otherwise.\n\nBe advised that LegoLand, CA, opens at 9:00 AM for hotel guests and 9:30 AM for everyone else. On the days we attended, the park had a staged opening, meaning only parts of the park were accessible upon opening. In fact, we had to wait until 10:15 AM to access a part of the park that had a very sought-after attraction. So much for early access.\n\nThe park closes at 7:00 PM, and does not really have bright lighting to assist with exiting the park. This may have something to do with its proximity to residential neighborhoods, and coastal views of those neighborhoods.\n\nIf your family are RABID fans of Lego toys, your entire family will have a lot to enjoy. If not, there is not a whole lot for everyone to get into, which relegates parents to the role of experience curators for the kids. Our family is pretty big into Legos, and even we struggled to get excited about the attractions at the park.\n\nOf course, being that our visit was during a typical vacation time for families, there were a lot of other families there, too, and lines for pretty much everything were long. We expected this, which weighed on our decision to stay at the hotel. By mid-morning, all lines were 45 minutes-plus. The park has their own version of a Fast Pass like Disney parks have, but are not offered to all park patrons, making most of the time spent in the park line time.\n\nAs far as attractions in the park, they center on younger-aged rides, such as mild roller coasters, as well as video-motion rides, with themes geared toward the different \"types\" of Lego toys (Ninjago, Technics, etc.) and carnival games that offer prizes that, at least to me, seem oddly incongruous for a Lego park. None of the stuffed prizes are Lego-themed. Seems odd, since we thought that, being a Lego park, the operators would want to saturate the environment with Lego-related goodies, and we were actually looking forward to that aspect.\n\nIn several of the sections of the park, supervised brick building areas were set up, but several had certain times that contests were to be held. We did not participate in those, so I have no useful info to share.\n\nAlso of note are the numerous souvenir spots, including many opportunities to purchase Lego building sets. Nothing special here: any of the Lego sets offered at the kiosks and shops can be gotten anywhere else. No discounts were offered on any sets, unless you are a Merlin Club member, and that gets you 10% off.\n\nThere were two big pluses for our group. One was the miniature displays made of Lego bricks. There is an entire section of the park dedicated to the use of Legos to make mini versions of widely recognized places of note, such as San Francisco, Manhattan, and the Taj Mahal. There is also a large section dedicated to incredibly lovingly-recreated Star Wars scenes. They are homages to each of the movies, Episodes I-VII, including a giant Death Star model, and a huge recreation of the trench scene in A New Hope. All the kids in our group spent the most time on this section of the park.\n\nThe other huge plus for us was the food selection at the park: the food. There is very good local beer and wine available at at least one food area. There are numerous excellent breweries in the San Diego area, and many were available at the beer stand we visited many times. Also, all the food we ate in the park was first rate. We enjoyed barbecue and smoked, slow-cooked meats and sides, Vietnamese wraps, and of course burgers and fries. Prices were \"amusement expensive\" which was to be expected, but was not unreasonable, especially considering the high quality.\n\nOn both days we visited LegoLand, CA, we were in the park at closing. Being a winter visit, it got dark at about 5:30 PM, and we found it disorienting navigating the park in the very low light in the outdoor areas. The weather was very mild: low 70s by mid-morning.\n\nWe did not park in the LegoLand lot, so I have no info to share there.\n\nTo summarize: our 9-year-old is about maximum age for this park, even though we all are pretty big Lego fans. Our younger one loved it and wants to return. Both days, the kids indicated that they were tired, and wanted to return to the room to rest.

LEGOLAND exceeded all of my expectations in every aspect. Whether it was the kid friendly attractions, shows or just wandering around Mini Land, LEGOLAND delivers a world class experience.\nImagine walking into Storybook Land at Disneyland where there is ample space for human beings to walk, room for strollers, room to wait in line, room to sit down on a bench and relax.

As far as kids free, our experience was far from that. I had purchased discounted two day passes for the adults prior to going. On the first day, when trying to enter the park, we were told to go to the customer service office. Customer service then proceeded to tell us that the kids were in fact not free as we had discounted tickets for the adults. I was informed that the only way the kids would be free was to purchase the adult tickets from their kiosks. Customer service offered to either refund the price of the adult tickets or to sell us full priced tickets for the children. Of course leaving us standing there with excited children to go to Legoland, the only choice was to pay the full price for the children's passes. The price for one two-day pass for a child was more than what was paid for for both adult tickets combined. Legoland should not be involved with the kids free October for the city of San Diego. We went to the zoo, Belmont and several restaurants and had no issues with the kids free promotion for the month of October.\n\nUnfortunately, this was not the end to our disappointment with this park.

Starting with the hotel, it's a brightly colored, noisy place with a big castle in the middle. There's a disco in the elevator. It's great; you need playfulness and silliness to appreciate it as a grown-up. But to really get immersed in it, you need to have some kids in tow.\n\nFor example, if I were to have done this on my own, I'd have spent maybe an hour or so admiring the Lego models then run out of stuff to do, in which case, I'd have just retired to the hotel bar. Except the hotel bar is right beside that castle in the middle of the lobby, and just sitting there and drinking a beer whilst watching the children play when none of them are yours is a great way to to get the cops called on you.\n\nSo no, no one wants that. Instead I took my nephews on rides around the park. There is less emphasis on thrill rides; the rides often involve physical challenges and exertion. Smart move, Legoland. Tire out the kids so they conk out as soon as you return to the hotel. Got a good workout with all the walking, and even got a bit of an upper-body work out at the Lego Police & Fire Academy. And the park may be small, but that's okay, it closes at 5pm anyway.\n\nSo what do you do after it closes? You go have the dinner buffet at the hotel. They've got a pretty impressive array of food: carving station, pasta, vegetables, soups, a little bit of everything. And of course they have an entire buffet island of kids' faves right in the middle, and it's set a little bit lower so the kids can serve themselves (with appropriate supervision).\n\nWhen you sit down at your table, expect the best serenade EVER from the legendary dread pirate Cap'n Looty! He'll play his ukelele for you, sing song, tell jokes, and trade minifigs.

Then to renew the online purchases st Guest Services was a Line day off. Next you had to go inside and stand in another line to redeem the tickets for a wristband and that took forever. The absolute lame part was the Candy / Treat station...most had a freaking maze to walk through and it was literally their attraction lines and it made us felt like a Hampster or per mouse. Event was pretty poorly planned and the stupid mazes are the absolute worst. However, my son ranked it a 10/10 because he's 7 and had fun and that's all that really matters! It's for the kids and my son is happy!\nShow less"]]}}
