Those in charge of the parking lot randomly choose to close it when they feel like it whether there are a dozen spots available or not so we circled twice and finally forced them to open the lot b/c we could see spaces open. The lame explanation given was that they had limited parking and did not want to over burden the lot (if a giant parking complex downtown can keep up w/ how many spaces are open then I would think a surface lot of about 100 spaces could figure out how to do it). Even a sign at the entrance that spaces were open at the LACMA complex would be helpful but instead just cones across the entrance and people waving you away.
