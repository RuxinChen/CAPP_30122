It\u2019s a great place for a walk and to look at the sea lions and seals. We came here in January and they are always here, but whether they are at the cove or a different spot nearby just depends on the surf. Be aware that the area near the wildlife is pretty smelly. Also when they are by the cove there are stairs to climb down but don\u2019t be the person that gets up right close and disturbs them.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 19, 2018", 5.0, "Loved our visit and time in La Jolla", "Our family of 4 (kids 10 & 12) thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Cove yesterday! We loved seeing the sea lions basking in the sun. And the scenery is amazing! We were very sad to see people getting way too close to the seals in order to take pics and selfies. The seals would move away as people got closer but apparently the people are either not smart enough to know they are scaring them or they simply don\u2019t care. I sincerely hope the seals don\u2019t stop coming to this amazing place if the people don\u2019t stop invading their territory.

We were here the night prior and experienced a ton of seals and sea lions. They were everywhere and very vocal. There are signs up telling you to keep your distance - sea lions can be dangerous, but even just sitting on a bench close by - they are still sooo close. Besides the seals - the beach and facilities were very clean and taken care of. It was very peaceful and serene..
