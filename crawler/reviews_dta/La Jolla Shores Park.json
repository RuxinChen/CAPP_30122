People had day tents and shelters set up and kids were having so much fun running around digging holes (be careful not to twist your ankle in one) and swimming. The water seemed cold to us, but we are used to a heated pool. The ocean water temperature is usually in the 60s in the summer months...sometimes closer to 70 by Fall.\n\nThere are a couple of lifeguard towers and a jeep that patrols the beach. I saw a rescue boat with 8 hang-on bars for rip-tide swimmers and surfers who get caught out too far and need to be rescued. I also saw several surf instructors for children demonstrating how to use a surfboard and the precautions necessary to be successful.\n\nIf you are a sun-worshiper, you might like to spend the day, but sit under a large umbrella so you don't get too much exposure. Many people were very red, and probably didn't apply an additional coat of suntan lotion (50 block is best) after swimming.The sun seems very intense here. You might like to take a camera to capture all the fun moments... protected from moisture, sunlight and heat .\n\nI wore hiking boots and a hat on the sand only because we were supposed to go hiking first, but were distracted by this beautiful day and walked on the sand instead. I'm glad I did. Something bit/ touched my husband's toe on his right foot (probably a jelly fish). He complained and later his whole toe and foot became swollen and covered with blisters. He went to Urgent Care at Torrey Pines Scripps Hospital for an antibiotic shot and bought a strong antibiotic cream.Although an unusual event, there are small bees and stinging things around. That is why I normally wear flip-flops.\n\nWe just love the freedom of the beach. Probably what I liked least was the amount of seaweed washed ashore after the last high tide That attracts bugs. As far as I know, the beach is not combed except in front of certain hotels that you can walk by.\n\nParking can be a problem on hot, sunny days. There is a large parking lot for 500 plus cars, but it fills up fast. Get there by 8:30am or sooner for a parking spot, Otherwise you will be looking for a spot along the curb on nearby streets and will have to carry all your gear several blocks.\n\nSo you can have a perfectly wonderful time at this beach. Another beach we love is Wind an' Sea Beach which has beautiful rock formations that La Jolla Shores doesn't have. It offers some protection from the wind and provides some shade.Also it offers several streets where you can park along the curb if the La Jolla Shores lot is full. The Shack is a great place to catch a burger and beer for lunch, just off La Jolla Drive...casual outdoor atmosphere!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 22, 2017", 5.0, "Excellent view", "The views are wonderful and it is a great play area for children steps away from the beach.

There are many things you can do at the Shores. All under the watchful eyes of the San Diego Lifeguard Station, beachgoers can enjoy all activities ranging from kayaking, scuba, surfing, boogie boarding and swimming. Close to the shore, many businesses cater to the equipment needs of the beachgoers, for a reasonable fee. Personally, I like watching the surf competitions. I believe the last time I was there I was able to watch local high school teams competing. On another note, just going down to the Shores to walk along the boardwalk, walking in the sand or playing in the water is well worth the visit. Parking can be a bit of a problem due to the volume of people. So, get there early! Remember, surfers normally get there during high tide. So, for parking reasons, observe the local weather channels for the surf reports.\n\nRegarding the questions below:\n\nIs this attraction a hidden gem or off-the-beaten path?\n\nI wouldn't say it's hidden. You do have to navigate through many small streets to get there or just take the main road down past Scripps Institute of Oceanography and it will get you where you are going.\n\nDoes this attraction have good sunrise views?\n\nAbsolutely! Watching the sun come up over the hills is beautiful.\n\nIs this attraction good for big groups (greater than 5)?\n\nYes. They have surf competitions sometimes and some group gatherings from the local colleges/high schools.\n\nIs this activity accessible without advanced planning or reservations?\n\nHmm. Not sure about reservations. I would assume that you would have to coordinate with somebody regarding a large event for security, trash, etc. So, I don't know. But, I definitely believe that you should plan the visit or event in advance. I think I've seen a wedding down there as well.\n\nDoes this activity require advanced planning, ticketing or reservations?\n\nSame info as above. Definitely plan in advance. Unless there is some special event planned, i.e. a concert or something, I don't know about tickets, reservations.\n\nIs this attraction in a remote location?\n\nI don't think so. I mean, I've been down to the La Jolla area many times. Just know it is away from the main roads but easily accessible. Parking is the issue. Find a spot, your golden.\n\nPlease keep in mind that anywhere you travel there are weather related issues. For example, if it is overcast out, which we get along the beach, there will be a lack of sunshine/no sunrise/sunset to see, perhaps cloudy or poor visibility for diving, rough waters, etc. Like any city, there are many people trying to do what you are doing. So, don't get discouraged. Keep looking and you will stumble upon a spot. Look for the surfer who is wrapping a towel around their waist (top and bottom for the ladies) and changing out of the wetsuit. Most often they are planning on leaving soon. Just ask them and put on your flashers while waiting.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed April 11, 2017", 4.0, "A wonderful find on our trip", "We just had to stop and check out this site, as we travelled the coastal highway.
