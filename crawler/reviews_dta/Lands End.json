The 38R bus ends up right at the National Park Building. There are restrooms available here. The hike is not too difficult, but stunningly beautiful. It is well marked and well maintained. It is a hard pack surface with lots of use. So, as I said, you don't need a guided tour. If you walk all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge it is 4 1/2 miles. Once you get to China Beach, which is not so well marked, the walk moves from woods to mostly city streets and is a bit difficult to follow unless you use your phone navigation. Using the phone it's easy. From Lands End Park Station it is about 1 mile to Mile Rock Beach, which is well marked. The walk down and particularly back up is a bit strenuous; but it is amazing and well worth the effort. When you get almost to the bottom there is a trail to the right going up a hill. At the top of the trail is the Labyrinth, which is interesting and the views from up there are great. Mile Rock beach is great for just enjoying the ocean and the views and climbing around on the rocks by the water. You could have a great relatively easy hike by just doing a round trip from the Park HQ to Mile Rock Beach and back and skip going all the way to Golden Gate Bridge. If you do decide to go all the way to Golden Gate Bridge there is a bus stop and you can take the Golden Gate bus back into most areas of town. Of course UBER is everywhere also.
