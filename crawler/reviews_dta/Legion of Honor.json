Today it's part of the Fine Arts Museum of SF. We were able to walk in and buy tickets for the Monet: The Early Years exhibit at the De Young, which was tremendous. Afterwards, we viewed the collection of Rodin sculptures which Mrs. Spreckles had collected in her lifetime. The setting is tremendous and the views of the Golden Gate Bridge from the grounds is amazing. The Palace of the Legion of Honor was the western terminus of the Lincoln Highway, the first improved road for automobiles across the U.S., which originated in Times Square, New York! Be sure to find the gorgeous Lincoln Park steps at the corner of California Street at Outer Richmond. The 52-step path looks as though someone rolled a colorful tile rug down its jagged slope! We walked from Nob Hill (about 10 miles R/T), but public busses run all the way to the Legion of Honor, down California. You can also save money on admission to the art exhibits, from destinationcoupons.com, savvycalifornia.com etc.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed April 27, 2017", 5.0, "Beautiful Museum!", "It's not a large museum, but it is well curated and beautiful. The Monet exhibit was a treat. Coupled with the deYoung it makes for a nice rainy day activity, which is how we spent a recent Sunday in San Francisco!"], ["Reviewed April 26, 2017", 5.0, "Rodin Sculpture Collection", "Alma Spreckels collected many Rodin bronze sculptures in the early part of the 20th Century and donated them to the City of San Francisco Fine Arts Museums. The \"Thinker\" is located in the courtyard entrance, with many more inside. Totally worth a visit for an unforgettable afternoon of Rodin! There is also a cafe on the museum's lower level....perfect for taking a pause!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed April 25, 2017", 4.0, "Very good museum, a bit of Europe in San Francisco", "We visited for the Legion of Honour Claude Monet special exhibition. The Legion of Honour is one of our favourite Bay Area art museums; when we miss the art museums in Europe, this museum gives us a taste, however briefly. The audio guides could be more informative. The cafe provides a peaceful respite and serves wine. If you visit this museum more than once, it is worth getting an annual membership (dual with De Young), and helps to support the arts. Go early to avoid crowds and tour groups.\nShow less"]]}}
