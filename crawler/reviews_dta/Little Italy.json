The variety of Italian restaurants and others commingled with residential and office buildings makes for a quaint laid back atmosphere and neighborhood. Everything is within walking distance and it is also within walking distance to the bay front area and the USS Midway museum. While in San Diego, it is the must go to destination for lunch and dinner as there is not a bad restaurant that I have tried.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 3, 2017", 5.0, "Little Italy Food Tour", "This is a great way to see the area and taste authentic Italian food!

We made a special trip today for the absolute best 5 block Street market we have ever visited. The neighborhood is quaint and all the shops and vendors had such a friendly easy going style. The food is top notch and so worth a visit if you're in downtown SD. The streets are walkable friendly and there are plenty of spots to take cool pics.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 1, 2017", 5.0, "Little Italy Food Tour", "This food tour was absolutely fantastic. Anthony was one of the best, if not the best tour guide we've ever had. In fact he was not a tour guide at all. He's a member of the neighborhood, and knows everyone, and has a story to tell about them all. The food was terrific and his stories about the little Italy neighborhood of San Diego were very informative. We highly recommend.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 31, 2017", 2.0, "Not sure where it really starts or ends", "I know it's not exactly fair to compare, but how else can you rate Little Italy? I am familiar with Boston's Little Italy and what used to be great..Manhattan's Little Italy. This locale just doesn't have the feel of an Italian neighborhood. It's difficult to know that you are in Little Italy because intermingled are restaurants of all genres. I only saw one deli and it appeared to be part of restaurant. We could not locate an Italian bakery. We didn't see Italian flags nor hear the language. Perhaps, in its day it was more authentic.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 30, 2017", 5.0, "Bustling & good Italian food", "Wonderful atmosphere.The Sunday Farmers market is a must.Fresh produce of every type,from eggs to coffee and beautiful flowers"], ["Reviewed May 29, 2017", 5.0, "Our experience in Little Italy", "This was my favorite place. . .the food, the beauty and we visited a Catholic Church and it was beautiful."], ["Reviewed May 28, 2017", 5.0, "Fantastic place for food", "We visited this area from the \"Hop on Hop off\" trolly. we did not have much time to spend here but definately a place we will come back and spend more time."], ["Reviewed May 22, 2017", 4.0, "Love it", "My husband and I go here on weekend and we love it.
