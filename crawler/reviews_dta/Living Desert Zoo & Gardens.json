Regular visits to the toddler play days and strolls around the park during the holiday Wild Lights. Also, one of my favorite hikes in the Coachella Valley is the big loop trail. It takes about 2 hours to complete the full look and I would not recommend for small children unless they are carried in a backpack. The view as you reach the top is a BEAUTIFUL expansive look across the Coachella Valley. It's both a good workout and great scenery. Tip: you do need to buy an admission ticket or membership to experience the hiking trails, but as a bonus following your hike you can visit the animal. Be sure to check out their website or social media pages for updates on trail schedules due to weather.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 16, 2017", 5.0, "Great Zoo to visit !", "We have been members for 30 years and have enjoyed visiting for either an early walk before the Zoo opens to the public, a nice hike during the cooler months and to enjoy watching the animals and viewing the flora. it's a great place for all ages, and so many things to see and do. Very educational with the chat sessions, feed the giraffes, ride a camel, ride on a carausel. We are looking forward to the new entrance and lion exhibition.
