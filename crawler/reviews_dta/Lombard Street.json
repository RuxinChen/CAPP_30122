It is impossible to find a parking place near this section so people usually drive on or take photos on the move.\n\nLombard Street is an east\u2013west street in San Francisco, California that is famous for a steep, one-block section with eight hairpin turns. Stretching from The Presidio east to The Embarcadero (with a gap on Telegraph Hill), most of the street's western segment is a major thoroughfare designated as part of U.S. Route 101. The famous one-block section, claimed as \"the crookedest street in the world\", is located along the eastern segment in the Russian Hill neighborhood. \n\nNo matter at what time of day and even night you will find people in cars driving down this snake like road. Late evening is the best time to visit if you wish to have the experience, but then - few good photos.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 9, 2018", 4.0, "Free to wonder", "Top of Lombard you can drive it if you are game or take a cable car to the top and walk down.

Driving down this street does not allow you to appreciate it's character. There's a plaque affixed to a home @half way down the right side of the decent that talks about how the street originated.
