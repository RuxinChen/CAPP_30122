Admission for LA County residents is: $20 - Adults, $16 - Seniors (65+) & Students, Free for under 18, and free after 3 pm on weekdays. For non-LA county residents it's $25 - Adults, $21 - Seniors (65+) & Students and free for those under 18. Parking is an additional cost. They have a parking garage that costs $16 or there are several other parking lots or metered parking in the area, but you probably won't find any parking that's free.\n\nThe museum always has long term exhibits. Right now they have: Hidden Narratives: Recent Acquisitions of Postwar Art, A Universal History of Infamy: Those of This America, Wu Bin: Ten Views of a Lingbi Stone, Richard Prince: Untitled (cowboy), Pinxit Mexici, 1917/1918: Looking Backward, Stepping Forward Exhibition Image, A Tale of Two Persian Carpets (One by One): The Ardabil and Coronation Carpets, Found in Translation: Design in California and Mexico, 1915\u20131985, Creatures of the Earth, Sea, and Sky: Painting the Panamanian Cosmos, Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu: CARNE y ARENA (Virtually present, Physically invisible), and Unexpected Light: Works by Young Il Ahn.\n\nThe collections is spread across several buildings each with several levels. There is plenty of walking to be done, including crossing a street at one point, LACMA is the largest art museum in the western United States, with a collection of over 135,000 objects. Obviously not all are on display but many are. I thought they did a good job in the way they displayed them, using lighting and space well.\n\nWhen I visited I thought all the costumes from the Magic Flute were some of the coolest stuff on display. They were pretty amazing. There was a good amount of 3D art that I enjoyed as well, I liked several of the wooden pieces and sculptures.\n\nThere are three dining options at the museum, a coffee shop, a cafe, and Ray's & Stark Bar with nicer meal selections and reservation options on OpenTable. I did not check out the food places nor did I visit the gift shop.\n\nI am so glad I visited, the collection was extensive and interesting.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 4 days ago", 4.0, "Great gallery to kill a couple hours", "We love art, and we love art galleries, but we can only spend so long looking at all the beautiful works.

The elevator floor in one building would sink in certain areas if you stood there; the same was true in the Japanese pavilion in front of one of the exhibits. The LA Cafe had a reasonably OK menu, but the staff there could have worked in any no-name diner ...no personality and the dining area, like the rest of the complex was tired, the windows cloudy and looking like they could use a good washing. I was expecting something fresh and bright with some excitement and rhythm, but it was lacking. It wasn't that they were rude, they just lacked energy and some zip...just like time clock punchers! The exhibits I saw were not particularly interesting or extensive for a major metropolitan area museum. The American decorative arts section had a few nice pieces, but in style and design conscious LA, I would have expected much more. I was thrilled to see the \"made from life\" bust of George Washington by Jean-Antoine Houdon, the famous 18th Century French sculptor. After viewing it I later noticed three young ladies rather frivolously kidding around the bust as one was taking pictures of the others.

They\u2019re shaded by trees and have easy access to the backside of the museum.\n\nTIP #2 Get your selfies at Chris Burden\u2019s iconic cast iron street lamps known as Urban Light.

But be sure to check out the artist\u2019s lesser-known but equally impressive Metropolis II, where every hour, approximately 1,000 toy cars race through the dense network of buildings!\n\nTIp #3 EATING! A really awesome thing to do that not alot of people know about is the Cur-ATE series, where ArtBites founder Maite Gomez-Rej\u00f3n connects the dots between food, history, and art by taking guests on a themed gallery tour that concludes with a four-course meal inspired by the evening\u2019s art at Ray\u2019s and Stark Bar.
