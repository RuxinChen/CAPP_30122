And how much time can you spend looking at the movie star prints now that they seem to have them totally blocked off from the public? It may be a temporary thing, but at least on my visit in late October, all we could do was to peek over the barrier to see the prints closest to the barrier.\n\nSo this is a review of Madame Tussaud\u2019s Hollywood, but I wanted to give a recommendation of Madame as an add-on to any visit to the Chinese Theater which is next door. It was surprisingly pricy for two tickets, but I must say that my out of town visitor and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The figures, for the most part, are quite life-like and they do represent a large variety of Hollywood personalities. The best part is that you can pose with the figures for wonderful photos, and there were a few occasions where props were available to make the photos a lot of fun. Be aware that there are a few places in the building where the staff will take photos of you, some of which are against a green screen with elaborate scenes superimposed (OK, photo shopped) in the background. These for profit photos are reminiscent of the constant photo huckstering on cruise ships \u2013 I thought the price of entrance was enough without the added costs.\n\nToward the end of the visit, there is about a 20 minute film which evokes earthquakes, along with some fun effects such as wind blown at you, a bit of water in your face, etc. That film was very well made and the earthquake effects were terrific. Don\u2019t leave without seeing it!\n\nAt the end of the exhibits, there is a little gift shop. We did not buy anything (luckily), because as one leaves that little gift shop, you are ushered in a large gift shop with items all priced at $5, and some of those same items had been found in the smaller gift shop at higher prices! My out of town visitor was delighted with the $5 prices and bought a ton of kitsch to take home.\n\nSo in summary, Madame is an excellent add-on to any visit to Hollywood and Highland.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 24, 2017", 5.0, "Better than I expected", "I really didn't expect much but was very impressed with all of the wax figures.
