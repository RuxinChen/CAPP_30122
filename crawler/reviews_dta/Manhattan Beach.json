I spend several hours walking on The Strand or along the water. Close to the pier is where the beach tends to be slightly crowded on weekends. The beach is very large so it's easy to \"get away\" from other people if that's what you prefer. There are a few small public parking areas but they are usually full. It's a great place to people watch, particularly surfers and beach volleyball.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed March 17, 2017", 5.0, "Newest favorite place in the universe", "Manhattan Beach is utterly delightful.

To begin with there is a beach front sidewalk and bike path (separated) that runs the entire length of the community. Drive to the downtown pier and you will find numerous restaurants and retail outlets that fit into everyone budgets. Parking can be a challenge on the beach during the busy summer weekends but just a few blocks away parking can be located. MB is a very safe community that provides a wide range of community services that are available to all. One of the unique features of MB is the wide beaches which are only rarely crowded because of their expansiveness. The MB pier provides an opportunity for all to wander about 100 yards into the ocean environment--photos under the pier are a must for the visitor. If you want to check out the multi-million dollar homes that line the beach front sidewalk just meander along the sidewalk any day or evening of the week and peer into the windows.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed February 9, 2017", 5.0, "Morning run", "We ran couple times a week here alone with the strand.
