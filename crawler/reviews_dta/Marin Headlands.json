Visiting the city without renting a car, I chose to take MUNI bus #76x to visit the Headlands. #76x runs only on weekends and holidays, and about once an hour; checking times and stops on the MUNI website is essential to planning this trip; the MUNI phone access may also provide help to riders.\n\nThe bus takes riders over the GG bridge, views are wonderful of the bay, the city, and the Marin hills. The twisting hilly roads require slow travel, so riders have time to enjoy the views. My destination was Rodeo Beach and Fort Cronkhite where there is a national park visitor center.\n\nRodeo Beach is the last stop: get off the bus, check out the rest rooms, walk and beach comb for an hour or so. The surf was heavy on a sunny January day, and there were surfers on their boards enjoying those challenging waves. The sand is clean with interesting colorful pebbles, which by law may not be collected. I saw hawks and a great blue heron in the lagoon area inland from the beach. Uncrowded on this visit, the beach provided a perfect respite from the hectic city environment.\n\nWalk along a well-maintained trail about 3/4 mile from the beach to the visitor center, with a short uphill stairway at the end. The visitor center is in a small chapel building that was part of the old military fort, with displays about the natural and military histories of the area. Staff are very helpful and knowledgeable. A bus stop for #76x is a short walk downhill from the visitor center.\n\nDetails about visiting the Headlands are available at nps.gov, the national parks website. For visitors who wish to drive, be aware that traffic can be frustrating and parking challenging on weekends. The bus was perfect for this older traveler and the walks were safe and not too difficult.

Well-worth the time to see views and nature in this vast area."], ["Reviewed June 18, 2015", 5.0, "Bring your camera for the best views of the Bay Area.", "This 40-year-old preserve is quite extraordinary, assuring that development will not despoil one of the richest natural resources left in the country, only a half hour's ride from the City of San Francisco. The hiking trails are a wonder, with breathtaking views of the Golden Gate, the Bay itself and the Farallones.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 17, 2015", 5.0, "find the real charming of the city view of San Francisco", "i was firstly knowing this place by seaching some topic about golden gate bridge view. but when we really got there, especially when we came across a walking tunnel and see the \"hawks hill\" sign, it just hitted us so much. the headlands winds its way into the outside part of the bay and the Pacific Ocean, the perfect view of both the sides of the ridge, the historical military facilities, the lagoon, the sound of the ocean tides at somewhere back on the mountain where almost nobody comes.... it just expanded our expierence of san francisco so much, with less than 30 mins drive form the city.\nif you go to san francisco, i thinks this might be the 1st ranking of your places-must-go list.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 10, 2015", 5.0, "You haven't truly seen San Francisco If you have not been here", "The view is stunning and never gets old! seems pretty surreal to be at such a perfect distance from the Golden Gate Bridge. Tourists and locals flock here to get the best views of the city. I would suggest eating a sandwich while sitting on the benches overlooking the bridge-it's quite therapeutic. It's also a great place for bikers (tough ride though) and a scenic route for people who want to cruise by. I highly recommend it.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 8, 2015", 4.0, "Best views of San Francisco", "Truly stunning views of San Francisco and the Golden Gate - lovely winding route to the headlands, and some stunning walks at the end of it. Well worth the detour."], ["Reviewed June 3, 2015", 4.0, "Beautiful and crowded", "Great views of San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Pacific Ocean and SF Bay! There are old, WWII era artillery bunkers overlooking the entrance to the bay as well plus some hiking trails. Be alert because there are cliffs as well. Unless the weather is bad, you will experience crowds. This is a very popular place for locals and tourists too.\nShow less"]]}}
