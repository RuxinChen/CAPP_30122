The volunteer crew of about 12 plus an affable docent gave the 30+ passengers a great afternoon as they deployed the sails and began tacking back and forth across the bay. Also setting sail with us was the Californian, a replica of a 19th century revenue cutter. 300 years difference in these two ships showed dramatic progress in sailing innovation. While the Californian was a dolphin, our San Salvador was a sea cow. Ha!!! Hard to imagine the small galleon would have carried 100 adventurous people plus horses and livestock across the sea so long ago. Was surprised how stable the top heavy galleon felt. Everyone on board seemed very comfortable. (I\u2019m very prone to sea sickness so I made sure to medicate that morning thus had no problem).

The main museum, the commuter ferry, The Berkeley, was of particular interest to me, since I'm from the S.F. Bay Area, and this ferry was used there, like several, that were part of every day life. There is a wide collection of ships from different eras, including the Russian sub with a fascinating history from the Cuban Missile Crisis, made this experience unusual.You can clamber aboard and look around as much or as little as you want. There is also the resident \"movie-star\" ship, built as a replica of the H.M.S. Rose, a British frigate, and renamed the H.M.S. Surprise. Peter Weir purchased it from the HMS Rose Foundation in Bridgeport, Conn., and it appeared in the Russell Crowe movie, \"Master and Commander.\" There's also the replica ship that the museum and its volunteers built recently, of the San Salvador, which sailed into San Diego in 1542.\nFor recent history, I spent quite a bit of time at the exhibit on The Berkeley about the Swift Boats, which were built for and used by the military in Vietnam during the Vietnam War (aka by the Vietnamese as the American War), and much more.

The Star of India is perhaps the star of the show as well although personally I was most interested in exploring the soviet era diesel submarine. It was fascinating although I thought the audio history of the cuban missile crisis, while interesting, didn't lend itself that well to the space available and seemed a little disjointed to me. It was hard to get the flow of the events as they were running in a loop and so it was hard to time each section correctly.\n\nHowever this is a minor quibble. All the vessels are interesting in their own right and for a reasonable price one can get to see 6 or so and as I say, they are a varied mix of sailing ships, submarines, fast boat, ferry etc. Not all are open all the time but most seem to be available to tour 7 days a week. The fast vietnam boat was closed when I was there, only being open at the weekends.\n\nThe larger ships have staff to help you and fill you in on the backgrounds to what you are seeing. They are very friendly and knowledgeable. Overall a most interesting museum if you like to go over ships at your own pace (which I do) and there is plenty of time to linger as you go around. Some of the ships are replicas but the main attractions are authentic and the Star of India still sails once a year (maintenance permitting). It's a bit nerdy of course, all these places are, but trying to imagine life on any of these vessels really makes one think and that is the point I think.\n\nNot good for those who find it difficult to get around. Ships are naturally challenging for those with disabilities and this is especially true of the submarines where one is required to navigate small spaces and swing through hatches. It is really impossible to avoid this and indeed, there is a test hatch in order to ensure you can navigate your way through those inside.\n\nI could spend hours here but I was on a time budget.

I came in the evening on a Thursday and it was practically deserted. I only saw maybe 3 other people the whole time I was walking around so I had plenty of time to check things out. You can tour 2 different submarines (be prepared for very small confined spaces!). I was sweating bullets when I climbed out of the first one - not sure how sub crews could handle being in one of those for months at a time! Such tiny spaces!! The second sub was the world's deepest diving sub and wasn't quite as nerve-wracking as the first one I visited (maybe I was better prepared the 2nd time!). You can also tour the ship from Master and Commander, which was neat. My favorite was the Star of India. You can get cool pictures of all of the other pieces in the museum from the deck of the Star of India and it was just overall the coolest ship.

Lots to see.", "I can't say enough about this place. A must for locals as well as tourists. For $16 adult, cheaper for children and seniors. You get to go onto many ships and 2 submaries. Take your time as it's all self paced with places to sit and relax too. The Star of India sailing ship is the Star. Huge, multi levels to explore with a bathroom onboard. Another wooded masted ship next door too that was in movies including Pirates of the Carrebean with Johnny Depp. There's an old Russian Submarine with ladders and round doorways to maneuver through, about 5 doors like that. There's also an american sub witch is much easier to walk thru with full size doors. A great museum and other boats, including a pirate ship great for kids. All ages will enjoy this. Plan for at least 3 hrs to see everything at a leisurely pace. Longer for those that enjoy the maritime museum. Perfect location, paid metered parking, great views for a sunny day. You'll get your exercise too.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 28, 2017", 4.0, "Good, but limited, museum", "This museum consists of several docked vessels and a building with displays, a gift shop, and lecture halls / food area. Our group was there for a late evening social retreat as part of a conference.\n\nThe heart of this museum is clearly the ships:\nHMS Surprise, a reproduction British sailing ship used in both Pirates of the Caribbean and Master and Commander movies. The top deck is period and the second deck has a number of information displays on the ship armament and seaboard life.\n\nStar of India, a commercial sailing ship from the 1800s, used as transport for immigrants across the Pacific and for transporting fish from Alaska to California. Again, the deck is period and the lower decks have several informative displays.\n\nA Soviet and an American submarine, neither of which I toured. The soviet vessel was noted as having several tight passages and the American vessel was closed for repairs.\n\nThe building holds several displays of equipment and models, mainly of military ships.\n\nThis museum is worth a couple of hours, and combined with the Midway, which is docked nearby but not part of the museum, would make a good visit while in San Diego.\n\nAs a social event location, I found it pleasant. The staff were attentive and the food was tended well and of nice variety. The range of spaces offered good opportunity for discussions. The spaces were well lighted and well maintained.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 23, 2017", 5.0, "You Should Be Sure to Go", "Pick a nice day and go to this Maritime Museum. The Star of India and the San Salvador are gorgeous ships. They were working on the Star of India, but we still had access to most of the areas. The displays are well done and informative. The Russian sub has a 'passageway' mock-up before you enter the ship. I suggest you try going through it before you enter to make sure you really can climb through easily. There are about four or five of them once you're on the sub itself.\nShow less"]]}}
