It has been three years since the last visit. And, I was impressed. The aquarium made a lot of changes to make it more kid friendly.\nI highly recommend to get to the Sea Otter exhibit early for the feeding; like at least 40 minutes early to get a front window spot. I was amazed how deep the crowd became as I looked behind me. And be on top( second floor) so you can see the handlers do their demonstrations. You are not going to see much action by being on the first floor. I had lunch there. If you are a big fan of iced tea, do not get theirs. the tea is not even cold; it is at room temperature.\nThe parking has become a bit cheaper than before( the parking garage). It is a flat rate of ten dollars. Before, it was hourly so you can pay more than ten dollars.\nNow, it will cost nearly $50 to get in. It is getting very expensive.

We now live out of state, so this was a special return to Monterey and the Aquarium. First, I have to say it's a beautiful facility. We've visited many of the biggest aquariums around the country, and this one is still our favorite. We were disappointed to not be able to see the Ocean Sunfish in the Open Sea exhibit, but that was no one's fault. All the exhibits were clean and beautiful, and the animals looked healthy. We ate lunch there, and the food was overpriced and blah, but that's what you expect from a place like this. The french fries were good, though. The gift shop is extremely overpriced, so we didn't buy anything. After we left, we found some of the same items on Amazon for a much better price. I realize they raise prices to make money to support the aquarium, but I'd rather pay normal prices and donate money for their cause than to feel ripped off. Our biggest concern about our entire experience, and what put a damper on the entire day for us, was the rude behavior of a few of the other guests. One older woman was extremely rude to my family and said some terribly hurtful things to my adult daughter who has a disability, along with shoving her out of the way. All day long, were were literally being run into and pushed by teenagers and adults alike. We were there on a Thursday not near a holiday, but the place was extremely crowded. We were happy to wait our turn to look at the exhibits, but time and time again, we had people push us out of their way so they could see first. I've never experienced anything like this before, and I hope it isn't a new trend.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 4 days ago", 3.0, "overpriced; wonderful bird display", "For years I had been told to visit the Monterey Aquarium when I got to California, so imagine my eye-blinking surprise at the entry fees.

Nestled right on the ocean, with beautiful views and a heavy focus on natural beauty the city is a gem in itself. However, the highlight for most tourists in Monterey is the state of the art, breathtaking aquarium, The Monterey Bay Aquarium. This was what brought my girlfriend and I to make the trip down to Monterey in late December of 2017.\nThe sole purpose of our trip was to visit the Aquarium and to have a nice lunch in Monterey. The drive was beautiful and provided amazing views of the coast. Upon arriving traffic was quite busy due to the small streets of the city, however, we were able to find free parking just a few blocks from the aquarium. When we arrived, the line to get tickets was much longer than I\u2019d seen it on previous occasions but we were able to avoid most of it by buying our tickets online while we waited in line. Ticket prices were a bit expensive at $40 per person, but were ultimately worth it.\nThe mode of transportation used for the tour was a simple self guided walking tour. Due to the high volume of people in the aquarium the only mode of transport available for visitors is by walking. Although I do believe they offer some guided tours by employees the most common and efficient way to see all the exhibits is to simply follow the map and go to the exhibits you\u2019re most interested in. In our case, this method seemed to suit us well and we were able to see most everything.\nDuring our visit we were able to interact with many employees in various jobs and departments. The most notable of these employees would probably be when went to go touch the various see animals they have available for up close encounters. The employee running this area was a very kind elderly man who was a volunteer at the aquarium. He was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about his job and the animals, and, was able to tell us about the different animals in front of us. He was also very kind and treated us with the utmost respect while doing his job extremely well.\nThe service we received while at the Monterey Bay Aquarium was exceptional. From our entrance in the aquarium to our exit the employees were extremely welcoming and kind and made us feel calm in what otherwise can be a very overwhelming aquarium. The employees were also very passionate about their work and it truly shows in the service they provide. Employees were excited to teach us about the various animals and to grow our appreciation for marine life. In addition, the service provided at the information desk was super helpful in allowing us to further our entire aquarium experience.\nThe impact of The Monterey Bay Aquarium is unmeasurable. For my girlfriend and I the aquarium had a big impact. We had an absolute blast while there and were able to create create memories together. In addition we were able to deepen our understand of marine life and, specifically, grow our knowledge of the animals in living in our area and in our ocean. The impact of the aquarium will most definitely bring us back to experience it again. As for the impact that The Monterey Bay Aquarium has had on the local area, enough can not be said to describe it. Not only has the aquarium attracted new visitors from all around the world but it has also helped grow appreciation and a focus on nature in the community. In addition, the aquarium has become a major research center and has made discoveries that have saved marine life and protected the beautiful shores of Monterey and California. Finally, the aquarium has allowed for a multiplier effect leading to the growth of many great business and nonprofits on Cannery Row and around Monterey.\nIn conclusion, The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a perfect destination for any traveler whether it be with a family, friends, or by yourself. The aquarium is very manageable to get around, the employees are outstanding, the service is impeccable, and its had a huge impact on the local area and me personally.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 3 weeks ago", 5.0, "Best aquarium in the USA!", "We live in Santa Cruz and have been to the aquarium 50 times!

The rest of it was well laid out and interesting.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 23, 2017", 5.0, "Everything has already been said about the aquarium", "Seems especially geared for children but plenty of interesting things for adults as well. Get up close and personal with sharks, rays, and giant sea bass. Immerse yourself in the deep sea exhibit. Watch otter and kelp forest feeding."], ["Reviewed November 23, 2017", 5.0, "Aquarium on the Ocean", "Great aquarium with many great staffers who can answer many questions! Nice walk from parking lot to aquarium. You do have option to drop family off in front of aquarium too but the walk is nice."], ["Reviewed November 22, 2017", 4.0, "Great aquarium, overcrowded with kids on a Saturday visit.", "Our party of 3 visited on a Saturday in November. We loved the aquarium and it\u2019s exhibits, but it was really crowded with young children on the weekend afternoon. I\u2019d recommend a weekday visit for adults."], ["Reviewed November 22, 2017", 4.0, "Worth a visit", "Our children (14 & 11) loved it here, staff friendly, knowledgeable & helpful. Plenty to see, great facilities. Kids enjoyed touching the stingrays, starfish etc"], ["Reviewed November 20, 2017", 5.0, "Great experience for all ages!!", "We have been members ever since our second visit. We were hooked from the very first visit!\nSo many cool things to do and see for all ages. You will truly be inspired by all the amazing animals here. You will think twice on recycling more and keeping our oceans clean for our future and realize how truly important it is for all of us to do our part weather we live in California or just visiting...\nThe ray touch tank is a favorite with most. You do get wet so be ready parent's 2 change lil' one's shirts;)...\nBut sooo worth getting wet for opportunity to feel one of these amazing creatures even just once.\nAnd if your kids are willing to do a dive in the bay, pay the extra money for an experience you all can share for generations..\nI wish they allowed adults to go to go in with their kids, then maybe more people would do it..\nHopefully they will change the age restrictions soon..\nBut check all the behind-the-scenes stuff available. Especially if you have future marine biologists in the group.\nThey may not even know it until they meet face to face and fall I love with one of these amazing creatures.\nMost of us will never get to see or touch these guys in the wild. Especially the deep sea creatures they have on display here.\nDon't miss any exhibit they all are a must see...\nIf you become a member check the times and exhibit' s open at the time you Go, because they close alot of them for the night if you go after hrs at the member's only times...\nWe found that out after driving 2 hrs just to see the flap jack octopus and it was not on display that day.\nCheck ahead for what yr going to see. They have a live chat on their website if yr on yr way already and have last minute ?s\nDown side is the food is way over priced, so bring a snack or lunch if u have a large group.\nAnything around there is also expensive so plan for touristy prices.\nAlso heads up if u go to the wharf there are alot of homeless looking for hand outs.\nBut that's everywhere in CA..\nI would skip it and go see a sunset on the bay!!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 20, 2017", 5.0, "Big Aquarium, does not worth money u pay for entry", "Located in a small city Monterey, its the main attraction inside the city. Its good to pass to few hours inside. Its not through the sea, just a big aquarium."], ["Reviewed November 19, 2017", 5.0, "Not to be missed in Monterrey", "Monterrey's main attraction. Not to be missed. Very well organised and staffed. Wonderful experience. Directly on the water with great views of the bay and ocean. Lots of outside space. Proximity with ocean outside gives great context to the exhibits within and is pretty unique for a major aquarium like this. Overall, by far the nicest aquarium I have seen anywhere in the world. Great for families, friends, young or older.\nShow less"]]}}
