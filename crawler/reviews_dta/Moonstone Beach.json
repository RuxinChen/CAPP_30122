What makes this so different is that the beach is compiled of pea-sized and smaller gravel. It is made up of several different types of rocks, including \"moonstones,\" and other polished rocks. These include jade, colored glass and an assortment of other colored and multi-colored rocks. There is plenty of drift wood to choose from and dried out \"tubulers.\" These have taken on many twisted and coiled, flexible shapes. The gravel can be very unstable, since it does not pack down even with the tide. So, if you have hip, knee or ankle problems, the beach is pretty rough going. I have knee and hip problems, so I needed my wife to help stabilize me or help me up the inclines back to the stairs. Also, we found NO direct access to the beach. Moderately steep stairs are the only way up and down at the two beach accesses we found. I toughed both out, and was not sure it was all worth it when we finished each day. I would do it again. It was tough, sometimes hard-going, and always painful.... It was worth it for me. You will have to decide for yourself. The surf was gentle and rolling. Several large rocks are scattered throughout the water. We were lucky two out of three days with the marine layer staying well of shore by 10 AM to 1 PM. A wind-breaker was needed both days. On day three, the coast was \"socked in.\" Typical warmer weather situation. You never know what you will get. We live in the valley about a hour from San Francisco. We never head to the coast without checking live satellite/radar maps to find out the condition of the marine layer, i.e., how thick, how wide and how far inland it reaches. This is what you experience along the California Coast. Your best chance for clear, sunny and warm days occur in Winter months. So plan accordingly if you aren't FROM CA, and you want to enjoy the coast. Just remember that the whole state can experience the affects of the marine layer anytime of the year.

Lots of nice restaurants and parking. Many lively hotels and B&Bs all along the road. We were visiting before the high season so it wasn't crowded. We enjoyed watching the sunset from the many viewing spots. It was windy so bring a hooded wind breaker! It can get really chilly.\nDefinitely a place to revisit.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 13, 2017", 5.0, "Nice beach", "Nice beach with great views and long boardwalk.

It's easy to get to, that is, once you've made the trek to the somewhat remote Central Coast. There's a lovely boardwalk along the shore."], ["Reviewed May 8, 2017", 5.0, "Moonstone Beach has many moods", "Growing up in Hawaii, for me \"the beach\" has a much different vibe than the majority of the California beaches I've been to (except San Diego). So to me, having a beach that can change from sunny with the deepest blue water to gray and foggy and cold is kind of unusual. The locals say it was unusually windy, but the trees grow sideways so it's probably windy a lot.\n\nWe stayed at a hotel that was at the northern side of the beach, and there's a nice lookout on a point, and also beach access though the north side appeared rockier than in the middle. We walked towards the center area of the beach and found a lot of beach pebbles with people looking for moonstones.\n\nOne morning the beach was fogged in and gray, but the next day it was clearer. The ocean seems bluer mid-day to afternoon, and then changes again near sunset. If you want to photograph the sunset, go earlier than you think because the clouds can come in and it becomes dark fairly fast.\n\nTips for comfortable walk along Moonstone beach -- windbreaker / shell to wear over whatever to stay warm, especially morning or near sunset. It was beautiful, but quite windy.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 5, 2017", 5.0, "Nice Beach Walk!", "Really relaxing and fun to walk this beach.
