It was on a holiday weekend and it seems they have changed things up a bit. Holidays and weekends you have to park in certain areas and there are shuttles that will take you to the main attractions. I knew the places to visit so it wasn't too hard to make sure we wanted to see what we wanted to see. When u first enter the park they give u a map of the forest plus a map of the shuttle areas and times. There were quite a bit of people visiting but was nicely surprised by the efficiency of the shuttles. BE PREPARED TO BRING YOUR OWN WATER AND SNACKS. There is a gift shop and museum but only souvenirs were being sold. They did have a water fountain. On the week days there are no shuttles so you can park at the different attractions but parking is limited but probably isn't too bad since there may be fewer visitors.\n\nI've been there a few times around May/June time and it was very hot in the 3 Rivers area just before you enter the park but once in the park people were wearing jeans, sweaters, parkas, etc. So make sure you check the weather. I tried to use my Google weather app to prepare for the weather but it was wrong. I dressed for cooler weather and had my winter coat ready. It was way warmer than the app had lead me to believe. So bring clothes for various weather if possible. It wasn't too uncomfortable wearing and walking in jeans but it would've been much better with shorts and a light shirt. I'd also recommend tennis shoes or hiking books depending in how much walking u will do.\n\nI've been here many times with my children when they were of walking age without issues. It would be difficult for me to have small children in strollers especially if I would need to use strollers etc. If u plan on walking up Morro Rock be prepared for heights and to carry small children in alot of areas. It's not stroller accessible. The views are breathtaking.\n\nThere is a small restaurant called The Gateway just before entering the park. It's a beautiful place to have brunch/lunch/dinner. It's right next to a beautiful clear flowing river. The food is a bit pricey and u may have a bit if a wait if it's a weekend or holiday but if it's the only visit you will be making in this neck of the woods it's worth it. I'm spoiled. It's just a hop skip and a jump for me. Hope you have a great time!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 7, 2018", 5.0, "Amazing", "The best things in California are nature based.

The Sierra Nevada Mountains are full of granite domes, the most famous being Half Done in Yosemite National Park; Moro Rock in Sequoia National Park is a much smaller one that, happily, is easily accessible by car and short climb.

Although the climb only takes about 15 to 20 minutes, it is steep and they advertise, I believe, 350 steps. Our visit to Sequoia was marred by smoke from the many fires burning in Northern California during our visit. Even with the fires, the views were superb just halfway up the climb. It was actually less impressive from the top due to the smoke, but on a clear day I think it would be well worth the climb. Road access is by the Crescent meadows drive which leaves the General\u2019s Highway at the Giant Forest Museum.
