Along the way you'll see sea otters, seagull nests and maybe a Peregrine falcon. Depending on the time, you'll also see some fishing boats heading back in. Of course there are \"Do Not Climb or Enter\" signs all around the base of the Rock. If you get tired along the way there are benches and big rocks to sit on.

It's my favorite part of California. It seems far enough away north from the Los Angeles basin to not attract many tourists. It is also far enough south from San Francisco to not get many tourists from there either. This part of California is known for its sand dollars and Morro Rock and the beach here are full of them.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 9, 2017", 5.0, "Take a walk", "So needed to walk after my flight to SLO.

It turns out that Morro Rock is one of seven peaks in a chain stretching down towards San Luis Obispo. There's nothing to do on the rock itself as climbing it is quite dangerous; rather, the climbing is probably okay, but many people have trouble with the descent part and need rescuing to get down. There is a nice walkway from the town to the rock, it's possible to see sea otters in the bay, and there are a few very helpful signs describing the area, the rock itself, and the eco system.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed April 10, 2017", 5.0, "Quiet, simple, lovely", "Morro Bay is one of my family's favorite vacation spots, we are even thinking of retiring there.

Take a walk along the harbor Embarcadero and check out the otters and their young playing in the harbor waters.

That's about it.", "The surrounding area and beach is interesting if you're there to look for otters and other wildlife, but it can get very windy and there's not much to do once you are there since there are signs warning you that the rock itself is off-limits and dangerous surf can sometimes splash over the breakwater if you ignore the signs and walk out over the rocks. There is lots of parking though, so driving there for a photo op is probably the best plan but I wouldn't plan on staying longer than 30-45 minutes (and that's only if you're a photographer). Plenty more to do closer in town, where the views of the rock are actually nicer and you can rent kayaks and paddle out towards it if you like.\nShow less"]]}}
