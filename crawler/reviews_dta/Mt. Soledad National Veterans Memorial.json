Great spot for pictures and views. Enjoy the historical aspect as well. There may be an ice cream truck for treats, and there's a porta-potty. Worth the few minutes drive to get there.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 25, 2017", 5.0, "Beautiful Memorial", "The views alone are worth the trip, but so are the many tributes to US veterans. So many photos and histories. Bittersweet and touching and way too many have passed on. Hopefully to a place of love and rest."], ["Reviewed June 25, 2017", 4.0, "Great Memorial and Amazing Views", "I am Canadian. I found the memorial quite moving regardless of my nationality. The memorial is beautifully done. I enjoyed going around and finding the couples and woman that served.\n\nI visited during June gloom so our day was quite overcast when we visited.

I can only imagine what it would be like on a clear day.\n\nI was able to venture to this destination as I took the 'La Jolla & Beaches Trolley Tour' with Old Town Trolley Tours.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 24, 2017", 5.0, "Salute", "Went up the hills and was stunned by the gigantic cross.

This was only about 15 mins away from our hotel. Im so glad I convinced my hubby to go here. It's actually a memorial for veterans on top of the hill. You get a 360 degrees view of San Diego city. Going through the memorial plaques for the veterans was very interesting it was also a very nice way of paying homage to our veterans. We waited for the sunset and it was surely a spectacular sight to behold. Parking was ample on a Tuesday..There was no entrance or parking fees. I highly recommend you check out this site if you're in SD.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 12, 2017", 5.0, "Very fitting memorial", "A beautiful memorial to those who have served our nation.

I found the location absolutely stunning, and the walls of remembrance intensively moving. It was also unsettling to see new plaques being added, and spaces being prepared for new additions. The only thing I didn't like was the groups of people shouting to one another and messing around on the steps of this fine memorial.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 31, 2017", 4.0, "view", "Enjoy the view !
