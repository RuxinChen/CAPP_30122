The Redwoods and setting are worth the $10 admission fee, per person. The trees are truly something to marvel at. DON'T FORGET THAT THERE'S NO CELL SERVICE AT THE MONUMENT - meaning if you Uber in (like we did), you need to call a cab from the visitor center to get out. The cabbies know this and there was one waiting about closing time (7pm), to take us back to Sausalito. It should be about $40 back to Sausalito by cab, and $25 by Uber.

My friends and I wanted a staycation over the weekend, but didn't want to stay in SF/the city. We had dinner in SF then drove about 45 minutes to San Rafael for our hotel stay. We planned to go to Muir Woods on Saturday (it happened to be one of about 4-5 annual national park days so it was free). Weekends and holiday shuttle parking is great at the Pohono stop. Got there at 9am and caught the first shuttle up. 25 minute ride up ($5 roundtrip). If you drive up and attempt to park in their small lot, you should arrive before 7:30AM to be safe....otherwise you're walking a few miles up to the entrance (leave that energy for the miles of walking in the park).\n\nI had planned a consolidation of a few trails (canopy, sun, dipsea, bohemian trail) to get beach views, park view, and redwood trees, but there were a few trail closures due to yellowjackets and construction. Did not matter. We went for a hike and that's what we did. The main trail has a boardwalk/paved so it's flat and easy for those only wanting to go about a mile or so in. It's great for families with small kids. Once you go off the boardwalk to the trails you lose the large crowds. This time around, we did the main trail to hillside loop (2 mi, easy) and Fern Creek to Camp Alice loop (3 mi, moderate).\n\n-Main trail to Hillside Loop- super easy and you get to see all the beauty of the redwoods (and cathedral grove). You'll have people traffic on the main trail, but worth going to the end to loop back on hillside. It's an elevated way back toward the entrance so you're able to get the view of the below boardwalk. From end bridge 4 you're making a left to the Hillside trail, if you pass it you'll be going onto the Ben Johnson trail which leads to a couple of other trails I want to try the next time I'm there (they are a bit more strenuous). As we were passing a couple on their way back from the Ben Johnson trail they told us they just finished \"cardiac hill,\" which leads to runner trails.\n\nIt was such a quick hike that we wanted to do another one. Dipsea would have been nice, but it has an estimated 3 hr time so we did the Fern Creek one instead for 2 hrs.\n\n-Fern Creek to Camp Alice, slow incline so you're not in pain from a direct incline. We had only 2 or 3 other people pass us the whole trail so I was glad we chose a less busy trail. You get to walk along a creek, cross some bridges, get up and close to huge fallen tree trunks (and crawl under one to get through the pathway). Definitely liked this one better than the Hillside.\n\nGot to parking lot at 845am, shuttle promptly arrives and leaves at 9am (i think it runs every 25 min). After arriving, paying for the shuttle ticket at the visitor center, stopping for the restrooms at the entrance (there are none within the few miles passed this point), we began our hike at 9:45am and left for the shuttle at 1pm. There's a small cafe shop where the gift shop/restrooms are so after we were done with the hike, a snack was nice.\n\nI could have done another trail, but my friends were done. So, I'd say 2.5-3 hours is a good time frame if you're planning an itinerary. Mill Valley has their farmer's market on Saturdays and San Rafael's is on Sundays (it's BIG). Just in case you're looking to do other things.\n\nA couple of things-\n-It's redwood wood forest, you're going to be in the shade the whole time if you're only planning to stay along the main trail. IT WILL BE CHILLY.\n- A few trails have poison oak\n- Please don't let your little children run ahead of you on the elevated trails (we saw a kid almost run off the trail when his parents weren't quick enough to turn a corner for him)\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 2, 2017", 5.0, "Beautiful Muir Woods", "A must do when in San Francisco.
