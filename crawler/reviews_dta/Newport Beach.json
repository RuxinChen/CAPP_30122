We ended up walking to Balboa Island - which is not advisable as it took us forever to walk. I think it took us over an hour. If you plan to walk from Newport Beach/Pier to Balboa, definitely rent bikes! It's something everyone does and is a lot quicker/ easier than walking the distance. The nightlife in Newport is awesome, they have a great row of bars by the pier which were pretty live for a Tuesday night!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 13, 2016", 5.0, "A wonderful day!", "We love Newport Beach.

The evening light was golden, the waves curled and crashed. The seabirds and pier in the distance lent color to the scene. People walked along the waters edge, sat on the sand or bobbed on surfboards in the water. I don't want to imagine it at beach-going height of the year! Lifeguard stations, nearby parking and convenience stores, etc make this a good beach for recreation as well as peaceful meditation.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 19, 2016", 5.0, "Quite spots to enjoy the view and ocean.", "We were there on Monday and it was the perfect time.

Beaches along Balboa Peninsula runs west to east rather than most of the SoCal beaches, that runs north south. So it is a lot warmer in the afternoon when the ocean breeze from the west picks up! Beaches are wide and never crowded due to the limited parking! Best chance to park will be around Balboa Peninsula Point area at the end of the Peninsula! There are normally plenty parking early in the day! Wedge is closely plus there is a nice small public beach on the bayside just past M street! Only drawback, no public bathrooms!\nShow less"]]}}
