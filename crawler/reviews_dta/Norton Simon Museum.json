Whereas the Getty mostly focuses on European art from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, the Norton Simon also has that, but includes later artists like Matisse and Picasso and is even more geographically diverse with its impressive collection of Asian sculptures (mostly from India, Thailand, and Cambodia) downstairs. At the time of this review, Rembrandt\u2019s iconic Self Portrait at Age 34 was on loan from London and was the whole reason I came today as it is the first time it\u2019s ever been displayed in the United States.

The outside surroundings of this museum are as beautiful and serene as those on the inside of the museum. Famous sculptors' works adorn the front entry area of the museum as well as the beautiful, quiet and serene lily pad pond and garden area at the rear of the museum. A small and lovely outdoor cafe is positioned in the lily pad pond sculpture garden area where one can not only enjoy hot and cold drinks, including wine and beer, lunch, snacks, and small bites but the beautiful natural surroundings; surroundings that provide one the feeling of being in a nature preserve oasis! While the museum does require entrance fees, my recollection is that there are child/student and senior reduced fees available. The museum offers entrance at no charge at least one day per month, and stays open late on a number of Friday evenings. It is important to check with the museum for special exhibits, entrance fee prices, days and times when there are no entrance charges each month, children's and adult's activities, classes, films, special tours and programs.

We had time only to visit part of the museum (19th and 20th century art) on a visit that lasted several hours. We have visited many museums all over the world and agree that the labels on the wall beside the art work provide more than the artist name and date created. They give phenomenal background and details regarding each piece, written so well and in such a way that it impressed us enough to mention it here.\n\nWe visited on a Saturday, so the museum was busy with many multi-generational families--so nice to see. It seemed there were also groups of art students visiting with their instructors.

There are some big names here such as Rembrandt, Raphael, Cezanne, Monet, Van Gogh, etc... There were several pieces of art that I recognized as being famous even if I didn't always recognize the names. The collection for the most part was arranged in chronological order, kind of interesting. They have paintings dating back to the 12th century! Adults are like $12 I think, students with ID are cheaper and I believe kids under 12 were free.\nThe kids were pretty good about trying to learn about some of the art by reading the plaques but I wish I would have invested the $3 for each of us to have a hand held audio device you put to your ear, punch in a corresponding number for each piece of art and then learn about that piece. That would have been nice because you can jump around from piece to piece and just hear about the ones that interest you. If you have kids with you that are least 8 and up, I would highly recommend doing this, it will make it more interesting and easier for them to enjoy the art.\nThere is a lovely garden and cafe on sight. With kids, even older ones, I'd highly recommend planning a break at the cafe for lunch. Their food was expensive but also very good. I'm sure you could also bring some food in your own bag and no one would really notice.\nThey are extremely strict about having foods and liquids near the art! When you enter, if they see you have a water bottle, you will be asked to check it (they have a coat check-like desk). You can go back anytime during your visit and get a drink, it really wasn't a big deal. If your bag is over a certain size (like a back pack), you will need to check it (this may include large diaper bags, not sure).\nI would highly recommend you see the 30 min documentary about Norton Simon in their small theater. It was very well done and very interesting. They highlight certain art pieces in the exhibit (such as the ivory elephant chess set near the gift shop and the beautiful still life by Zuburan of lemons, oranges and tea cup and the picture of a child by Rembrandt.) If you try to show the kids some of the pieces highlighted in the film, they will be excited to recognize them while they watch it OR, see the film first and then make it like a scavenger hunt to find the pieces highlighted in the film. This would be fun actually! But we didn't see the film until 3:00, which was after we saw the art.\nOur group was there for about 4 hours and yet we only saw about half the collection and none of the special exhibits.

As we were leaving the museum, we were drawn back to view it yet again.\n\nAnother feature of this extremely well-designed building was an ability to see several galleries ahead, and what drew us through those rooms to the last one in this wing was a distant view of a huge installation by the American contemporary artist Sam Francis. Just getting to it was a thrill. The installation was three huge canvases, one perhaps twenty feet across by ten or twelve feet high. On an adjoining wall were two more very tall but thin canvases hung side by side but identical in composition, so all three had been done at the same time. I loved the freedom of these pieces, and their vivid colors as well.\n\nWe were finally lured away by the equisote outdoor gardens and pondside cafe where we enjoyed without guilt some delicious and creative pastries. The Norton Simon is a genuine treasure - thank heavens our son lives in Pasadena as I think I will be visiting this shrine many more times!

I was surprised and impressed by the range of artists represented. A serene sculpture garden beckons visitors outdoors, and a small cafe offers snacks and light meals. Conveniently located at one end of downtown Pasadena, there's really no excuse for art lovers to miss this fine museum. In fact, if you're someone who's overwhelmed by mega-institutions that require a full-day visit, this is an appealing and highly rewarding destination.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 8, 2016", 5.0, "Amazing collection", "This beautiful museum in Pasadena has an amazing collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings and a lovely sculpture garden. Lots of Degas. Definitely worth a visit."], ["Reviewed October 8, 2016", 4.0, "Inside and outside beauty", "The Norton Simon Museum offers a wonderful display of artwork both inside the museum and in the sculpture garden. A viewer can wander or sit to enjoy the beautiful displays of artwork inside and outside."], ["Reviewed October 6, 2016", 5.0, "The 30 minute movie is very interesting", "Our youngest daughter lives in the area, and as we visit her often, we have visited this Museum at least half a dozen times. I never reviewed it, as what is there to say? This Museum has so many masterpieces, that today, (10/6) we spent over four hours there, and wished that we had had another hour. On Thursdays, they are open noon to five.\n\nThe Museum Cafe has improved. About eight years ago, we met friends for lunch there, and it was such an unexpected disappointment. We love Museum restaurants, and always enjoy a nice meal at just about all of them. Here, the catering seemed to come from Costco. Large unappetizing portions prepackaged in clear plastic containers, and very few choices. The Cafe setting is among the loveliest but, the food was uneatable, and all four of us left it in their plastic. Today, we enjoyed our lunch. We split a \"Ham on Rye\" sandwich, and a Bass beer. The sandwich was freshly made and tasty. I saw no prepackaged sandwiches.\n\nWe always enjoy browsing in the Gift Shop, and I've often bought my Christmas cards here, but they are not out yet this year. There are more guards (inside and outside) here, than we have ever seen in any Museum anywhere. Not surprising, when, most likely, there is nothing here valued at less than several million dollars, and you can get very close to the masterpieces.\n\nEvery day, at 12:30 and 3pm, they show an interesting 30 minute movie about Norton Simon. It's shown in their Theater, which has the most comfortable cushiony seats, and the slope is such that there is a good view from any seat. Today, we watched the movie for the third time. We really enjoy hearing about how his passion for art developed. Surprisingly, so few people come to watch the movie. Today, there were only five of us in the Theater. It is very well worth seeing.\nShow less"]]}}
