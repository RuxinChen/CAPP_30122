Excellent fishing and friendly conversations with the locals and other travelers."], ["Reviewed June 24, 2017", 4.0, "Neat Attraction", "The pier is at the beach and one of the longer wooden piers I have seen anywhere. Great for people watching, surfer watching, dolphin viewing, or just a cool walk. Lots of people fishing off the pier as well. We went all the way out to eat at Ruby's Diner and after a short wait, we had a great burger, shake, and fries. A great place to eat. The only negative may be the parking. The streets are metered but not every meter accepts credit cards. Bring plenty of quarters. They are hard to come by.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 23, 2017", 4.0, "Good for a walk", "Oceanside has become a powerful tourist attraction, and it has hotels, motels, house rentals , time shares, paid parking meters to prove it. Needless to say, it is a sight to behold!From $10 Tacos, to bicycle rentals, and of course, the majestic Pacific Ocean, which makes it all worthwhile. The weather is also very kind to all who stop by.\nThe Oceanside Pier is a great place to go for a walk, bringing memories of times past, while enjoying a panoramic view of Oceanside life. Good exercise that is almost certain to revive appetites, so perhaps a well thought of picnic fare, might be more prudent approach. Unless, of course, all is well in fat wallet city, and then all temptations are within reach.\nOceanside Pier, boardwalk, sand and surf, it is truly a memorable experience in every way.
