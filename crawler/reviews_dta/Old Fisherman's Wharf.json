One of the things they do now is they have samples of clam chowder out in front of just about every restaurant, they will also give you a free complimentary entree with any meal you purchase including a clam chowder bread bowl. Normally calamari strips or something very small not much of it but its free.. The clam chowder bread bowls range anywhere from $9 to $15 depending on the restaurant. I would suggest you try them all because they are all very different some very good some terrible. Surprisingly the stores are not too expensive for sweatshirts or logo Monterey souvenir hoodies tee shirt's.. unlike the clam chowder most of the entries are around the same price throughout the pier. One of the things I must mention the clam chowder that you taste outside of the restaurant that's full of clams and taste delicious is not the same when you get inside. It was hard to find any clams/ bacon in the chowder. It's like the old bait-and-switch we ate there at two different restaurants in two different days same thing happen both places. It's not as good as the San Francisco clam chowder or Pismo Beach area. But again this is a tourist trap area do your research.
