Carmel Mission is the burial site of St. Junipero Serra and Sonoma Mission in the Sonoma Plaza is the northernmost.\n\nBut Mission Santa Barbara resting high atop the city of Santa Barbara is probably the most important for its grounds and the fact that it is the home mission for the Franciscan Friars.

Still, the missions existed and remain and so does our native Chumash community. I would like to see more inclusion of the Chumash culture at the mission. The fact that the mission is so beautiful shows the artistic prowess and dedication of the Native Americans who actually built and decorated the missions and were an integral part of them.

Once we got through the ugly parking lot, we tried to get into the mission grounds. We were there around 4:30, and were told that the last tour left at 4:15, and we were not going to be permitted to enter the grounds. The website is not clear, and only stated tour times. Otherwise it seemed the missions was open until 5:15pm. We did not want a tour, so the last tour leaving at 4:15 seemed like it should not be a problem. But it was. I asked if we can just pay and quickly take a few pictures. Answer \u2013 No! Why? I guaranteed them we would be out in 10 mins. Still No!\n3. So we figured we would salvage the trip here and at least go into the mission church before the mission closes. Wrong again. There was a mass from 4 to 5 and we were not permitted to even enter the church. I get it this is a church, but make mass from 5 to 6 when you are not supposedly welcoming guests to see the place. This seemed like a poor selection to have a service time. Perhaps a little consideration for the folks who have driven hundreds of miles to see the place would be nice. Starting mass at 5 instead of 4 would be nice for those visitors. But do they care?\nSo after going through an ugly parking lot, being told no we can not even take pictures of the grounds even though there were lots of people still in the grounds, and not being able to even go into the church, we left.

The Santa Barbara mission is a good one to visit because you can get a good feel of the history and how it might have been living 200 years ago. While each mission is different there is a basic theme. So if you are into history this is a must stop if you are not then there are many other attractions in the area. The mission tour guide was very knowledgeable and well worth while. The church is still active and the facilities are in good shape. Also the area is pure California which makes for a beautiful setting. It takes about two hours to properly visit the mission and well worth it.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 7, 2017", 5.0, "History at its best!", "The old mission of Santa Barbara is one of the most iconic of them all, specially because of its elegant and large gardens. They have a museum inside (small fee) and you get to walk inside the grounds and visit the cemetery.\n\nThe church is still in use and regardless of your beliefs is a nice quiet place to visit.\n\nFrom state street is only about 5 to 8 minutes away. Busy on weekends, but they have a large parking lot. The gardens have a large collection of roses with benches and a large lawn to share a family picnic.\n\nComplement your visit to the mission with other historical sites in town - like the Casa de la Guerra, the presidio and the Santa Barbara History museum.\n\nWant to relax - enjoy a session on the Salt Cave right on state street and casa de la guerra st.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 7, 2017", 5.0, "History of California", "Historical site with a beautiful active church.
