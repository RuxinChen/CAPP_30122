The lighthouse with living quarters, complete with furnishings, the vegetable garden, area for collecting water and spiral stairs to climb provides visitors with a good idea of what it was like for the lighthouse keeper to live here while maintaining the lighthouse. Views from inside the lighthouse are as spectacular as from many areas at Point Loma and Cabrillo National Monument.\n\nThe Fresnel lens displays a beautiful colorful prism as light shines through the lens from outside. The original lens was too large and had to be replaced with a smaller version in this original Point Loma Lighthouse. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places this stop on a walking tour of Cabrillo National Monumental is well worth the time. Those with strollers or mobility concerns will not have any difficulty seeing the lighthouse - except the spiral stairs. The lighthouse may be explored in approximately 30 minutes. A treasure, visitors will enjoy the setting, the easy, paved trek to the lighthouse and the wonderful history the 1855 lighthouse provides. Very highly recommended.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 11, 2016", 5.0, "Cool vantage point", "You can go in and check out the Old Lighthouse and living quarters. Small museum in out building.
