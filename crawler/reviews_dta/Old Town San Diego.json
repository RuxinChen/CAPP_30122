It felt like going back in time with a touch of the Mexican and old western cultures. Parking is a bit hard to find and could be expensive depending on the distance. There are plenty of street store with memorabilia and vintage souvenirs. There are also a couple of museums and art galleries. Right in the middle of the town is a big field to have a nice picnic or lay for a siesta. There are Mexican and folk shows to view as well. Food is not an issue, restaurants are all around the town with delicious Cali-mex culinary taste. If you are planing to visit California, you must not miss this experience.
