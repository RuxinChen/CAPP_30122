This is a great area in SD and I highly recommend it!"], ["Reviewed November 27, 2016", 5.0, "Activities all year long.", "Besides just beach visits, there are endless water sports (surfing, windsurfing, paddle boards, etc.) and other beach activities. Even beach fires are allows. Dogs are allowed at certain times of the day. Joggers love the beach or the strand way, which is also crowded with bikes, rollerbladers and all types of motion. People watching is great and just starting at the huge waves could be an all day activity.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 26, 2016", 5.0, "Had a great time.", "We stayed right off pacific beach about 15 years ago when I was a teen.

There's swimming and surfing, beach volleyball and lots of characters walking up and down the boardwalk! Just be careful of rip-tides if you're going for a swim - they can really catch you out if you're not careful!

I lived there for many years as I am an avid beach lover. I usually have a spot right by the Crystal Pier. As a beach lover you get familiar with the Boardwalk and the people all around it. Sufficed to say that laying on that sand and watching the waves, watching the families and children, seeing the Lifeguards is one of the most wonderful things about living in San Diego. I know all the non-touristy places to park and I don't mind walking a block or two to get to the beach. My family and I have even stayed on those cottages on the pier and that is truly a wonderful experience. Life is good when you are on Pacific Beach. Just remember sunblock and stay hydrated!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 7, 2016", 5.0, "Beautiful beach with incredible waves.", "There are some spots for swimming where there is less rip tide but I wouldn't bring a toddler here for fear of them getting swept away."], ["Reviewed November 1, 2016", 5.0, "Beach & Party", "This area is for youngster and hipster.
