Try driving Highway 1 from San Francisco north. It's gorgeous, awe-inspiring, 100% nature. You drive along the Pacific Ocean, through mountains and the Redwood forests. I challenge you not to limit your view from one of the many turn outs; but to hike part of the many miles of trails.\nRemember this is country, there aren't many fast food places or gas stops; you won't have 100% cell coverage. Dress casual, with good shoes and pack a coat. Many areas close at sundown.

Sadly a massive landslide had closed the road just south of Bixby so we had to come by the inland highway to Carmel-by-the-sea and then head south from there missing the section from Santa Barbra to Bixby which was heartbreaking. The 50 miles or so we could explore was worth it all the same with almost uninterrupted views the whole way. It was a little hazy but that couldn't spoil the grandeur of the drive.

Honestly, you could spend months to explore all the glory of California, but these few places you must visit, if you have not gone to these place, you need to re visit :).\n\nFrom LA, we drove 1.5 hours and arrived in our first city:\n\nSanta Barbara- it's small town feel, romantic, the downtown State Street is filled with little boutiques, restaurants and bars for you to enjoy.\n\nSolvang - Next, we took a slight detour away from PCH 45 min drive to Santa Ynez Valley, to visit this super charming town known as Danish village, you will feel like you are no longer in U.S.\n\nSan Simeon - 1.48 min. drive we arrived at San Simeon, where we spend the night, visited the famous Hearst Castle! Breathtaking tour, you have option to do the day tour or night tour, we did the night tour, it is during the Christmas Holiday, the castle is decorated with lights and christmas trees, performers wearing the period holiday costumes, really festival, truly enjoyable. During the morning, we stroll down to see all the lovely elephant seals along the boardwalk. truly beautiful.\n\nBig Sur - If you don't pay attention, you would drive right through it, but we managed to make couple of stops just to take in the stunning view of the nature and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nCarmel by The Sea and Monterey - Small beach cities on California's Monterey Peninsula. Truly the most romantic spots along the ocean, you can't go wrong pick either one of these two side by side cities to spend the night. Whether strolling into the boutiques and shops along the main downtown streets, or visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium, just relax, sip coffee, enjoy the easy life by the bay, California style.\n\nPebble Beach - Make sure to drive by Pebble Beach, it is an unincorporated community on the Monterey Peninsula in Monterey County, California. It lies at sea level, very sweet view.\n\nFrom there, it is about two hours drive San Francisco. The whole journey along PCH you can spend as little as 3 nights or, as long as you wish, it all depends how much you want to see, trust me, you can spend a lot longer if you have the time.\n\nBe careful making stops if you drive from LA to San Fran, since the ocean is on your left, you will need to watch out the traffic turning left (or walk across the highway) when stop at all the vista points.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 1, 2018", 5.0, "Fantastic Road Trip", "We decided to go for a Road Trip between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

You get a little bit of everything from twisty mountain/forest roads, to twisty shoreline roads, to twisty canyon roads. Note the twisty adjective on all of those. Pro tip: if you're renting a car to do this, make sure it handles well. There are long stretches where the road is constantly changing directions. Seriously, there are very few straight sections of the PCH.\n\nThis road is actually best experienced in a convertible. You want to be able to take in as much of the scenery as possible and there really is a lot of it to take in.\n\nIt's best to also plan out where you're going to stop for food and gas. There are lots of little towns along the way, but not all of them have accommodations.

What we can tell you about the experience is that the scenery is absolutely beautiful. What you really need to know is that it's a looooong drive though. Traffic in LA is the worst so before you get to Malibu you've been on your way for a while. If you like to drive and you have time, do the full route, but do it in 2 days as this will make your trip more enjoyable. Driving the full route in a day, makes it a really full day! About the PCH (Pacific Coast Highway) itself, there are loooong lengths of the highwayl that are - in our opinion - too long. So if you do want to drive to Monterey in a day, we recommend doing the 'highlights'. First of all, Monterey is a city, a mini LA actually. It is not a small town. So if you want to visit this, make sure you calculate your time right. About the scenery : Malibu is worth the visit - the beachhouses, the coast, the vibe - it's nice! Everything in between Malibu and Ragged Point is not really a must-see so you might want to drive to the main freeway in between these spots as this will cut you time. You can't drive directly from the main freeway to Ragged Point, you need to exit in Cambria (eat here since you will not come across much after this point!) and once you arrive there, you can get back on the 1 (PCH-route). If you follow that - you can drive to Monterey if you want, we finished the trip in Pebble Beach but if you finish at Carmel-by-the-Sea you've done the best part! What we can tell about the parks that you will come across is that they are forests. Anyway, do this trip!! Wether it's the full drive or only the highlights, everybody should have seen/done this!

Here are some of the bits of advice that I would offer:\n\n1. I recommend that you drive south to north. In that manner, you will be on the inside lane of the wild curves that are included on the PCH. When you come north to south, you are on the outside lane looking straight down the cliff to the water. Just a thought !!!\n2. Plan around the toughest place to get tickets for. The Hearst Castle is an excellent example of what I mean. Tickets for the tour are sold out early. Plus, your ticket has a day AND a time slot. Also, you may want to do more than one tour. You need to plan a place to sleep before and after.\n3. Gas Stations on the PCH are infrequent. Play it safe. Don.t let your tank get too low. As they say, don't pass an operating gas station.\n4. Get your list of places you want to see and map it out with hotels.Then, start working with a map on the miles between each site.\n5. Try going with one hotel chain (like Best Western) that has many hotels on the way. You can get a lot of points and maybe some pull to get a location that you want.\n6. Have an exploring nature ! For instance, we got off at the Pismo Beach exit because we remembered Pismo Beach from the Beach Boy's songs. We would a great place for lunch with a wonderful view of the coast !

Make sure you do the vista point stop after crossing the bridge if coming from south to north for pictures. If you drive from north to south, you can miss it by driving on it without knowing. LOL\n\nI did Point Lobos, 17 mile, and exploring Monterey all in Day 2.\n\nDay 3, drove home taking 68 to 101 fwy.\n\nTbe drive is beautiful and I am SO glad I did it. It is tiring, but do it at least once.\n\nPRO south to north-the drive is less scary because you are not driving by the edge of cliff (some parts have no guardrails).\n\nCON south to north-turning in/out of vista point is not as smooth as coming from the other way but no biggie.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 22, 2016", 5.0, "Nice way to travel", "Even if it's a little bit slower - it's a better way to travel then being stuck in traffic on the 101.

We rented a convertible camaro. To low to the ground you can't see a lot of the views because of the guard rails. We had the top down maybe a total of 3 to 4 hours the entire trip. To cold (58 degrees) and this was the and of July. Rent an SUV. More spacious better views.\nWatch for the Bixby bridge. I did not see any signs that you were coming up on it. I wasn't sure when we passed over it until we stopped at the elephant seals and then we were to late. It was way back up north. And that was one of the things I wanted to see (so bumbed). The elephant seals were very cool but still really cold. We wanted to stop at Hurst Castle but we just ran out of time. Big Sur is amazing. Beautiful big trees and amazing views.

We enjoyed hiking in Big Sur although a little more difficult for me to manage at times. We made a point to stop at every public beach so my grandson, age 10, could try his luck acquiring pieces of sea glass and sea shells. The tide pools were just as capitivating. The drive along Highway 1 is still breathtaking and other drivers seemed to have lowered their speeds as well.\n\nPicnics on the beaches were a welcomed alternative to the plethora of eateries along the way.

Here are my recommended delights and the disappointments we discovered on our wonderful (but quite expensive) family holiday.\nThis holiday can be done much cheaper and on a stricter budget than we did it. However my choice was to have comfortable hotels with swimming pools for the children.\n\nI have separately reviewed all hotels/restaurants and things to do on Trip Advisor.\n\nThese were our stops:\nSan Francisco 4 nights\nMonterey 2 nights\nSanta Barbara 3 nights\nLos Angeles 3 nights\nSan Diego 4 nights\n\nDon't miss San Diego. It is beautiful and now one of my favourite cities!\n\nI will tell you about my recommendations for each place but first here are some general tips;\n\nCalifornia is expensive so be prepared that you may overspend your budget. One hidden cost was parking the car. It always cost between $10-20 for a day in tourist spots and beaches and almost our hotels charged for parking about $20 per night over and above the cost of the room.\n\nCalifornia temperatures are cooler than you think in the summer because of the sea har (fog) and cool breeze. This is especially true anywhere north of Los Angeles. San Francisco was freezing! Dressing for the first week of our trip I would recommend a woolly hat and gloves-no kidding! We ended buying them because we left our winter clothes at home in Scotland! Especially needed for Boat trips eg Alcatraz and Whale-watching. Layer up. I did not wear my summer clothes and shorts until the second week-Santa Barbara and beyond. I should have taken more long-sleeved tops with me.\n\nCar Hire: a car is not require in San Francisco. We hired it at the start of the journey south. Alamo tried to tempt us with all sorts of upgrades. We upgraded the car for added comfort and it's built-in sat nav was very reliable. Remember to tell it what State you are in or your destinations won't come up in the list!bit took us a while to realise that ours was set for Texas when we picked it up. We regretted not taking the Wifi package. It would have been useful again and again for finding restaurants/ coffee stops recommended on Trip Adviser whilst travelling in the car. I would do that on a future trip.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO: Delights;\n\nAlcatraz was the highlight and a MUST but book well ahead of the holiday. It's one of the best family days out you will ever do!\nLombard Street was a quirky find-the crookedest street. It was fun!\nWalk or cycle the Golden Gate Bridge. We were lucky to see whales below the bridge. But it was absolutely freezing. Gloves/ woolly hats and jackets recommended.\n\nEat at 'Fog Harbour on Pier 39 for outstanding food, service and a view to die for! Book ahead if you can.\nMUST try The Codmother Fish and Chips! To take away of eat on their picnic tables. Scrumptious but share adult portions or buy kids portions as they are enormous!\n\nDisappointments;\nOur regret is that the hotel was at Union Square. With children you are better to be near the seafront and Wharfs.\nWe had a 3 day open top bus ticket. What a waste of money. Buy a one day pass to see round the city and use your feet or excellent and cheaper public transport for the rest of the time.\n\nSANTA CRUZ-afternoon road stop.\nWe headed south to Monterey intending to stop at the seaside town of Santa Cruz for a quick break in the journey. We were there for hours! The kids were in heaven.\nSanta Cruz has a boardwalk with an old-fashioned amusement park on it. It was brilliant and the sun shone on us at last but there was still a chilly breeze. The many rides were very cheap but parking cost $15\nFinally, we dragged the kids back to the car but it was well worth the stop!\n\nMONTEREY\nOver-rated and a tourist trap. My least favourite place on the holiday.\n\nMONTEREY-Delights:\nWhale-watching trip. The most incredible experience for us all. TOP TIP; take sea-sickness tablets ahead of the trip even if you have a strong tummy. I am SO glad we did! Wear woolly hats/ gloves/ warm jackets.\n\nFisherman's Wharf has great seafood restaurants. The place for clam chowder.\n\n20 min Coastal walk from Fisherman's Wharf to Cannery row is lovely. You can watch seals playing on the rocks.\n\n17 mile drive and Pebble Beach Golf Course-well worth doing. The drive goes from Monterey round the peninsula to Carmel. A charge of $10 though which grated a bit!!\nWe never completed it though because, being golf fans, we got sidetracked by Pebble Beach Golf Club which is about 11miles into the drive. We did not realise it was open to the public so we did get a lovely surprise to discover we could wander down to the 18th green and beach, see the trophy room and eat in the clubhouse grill.\n\nMONTEREY-Disappointments:\nCannery Row- totally over-rated, kitschy, over-priced and touristy. We did not hang about!\nAquarium- it's meant to be fantastic but would have cost us just under $200 dollars for a family entry!! So we chose the whale-watching trip instead.\n\nCARMEL-By-Sea\nWe wanted to see Carmel but by the time we left Pebble Beach the previous evening it was dark so we never completed 17 mile drive! So we stopped here for breakfast before beginning the 238mile coastal drive and Big Sur on the way to Santa Barbara. It was well worth the visit and I wish we could have spent longer here.\n\nDelights:\nPretty place and Free parking in the streets!\nLittle Swiss Cafe-perfect breakfast stop. Quirky and good food/reasonable prices.\nI will come back to Carmel for longer one day.\n\nNo Disappointments!\n\nBIG SUR DRIVE\nYou won't be disappointed. Plenty of stopping places along the way. All the cars driving it are tourists so everyone just having fun and enjoying the views. We did it in a day but I would love to do it in a camper van sometime and take more time to explore the various state parks along the way. My sons watched whales out at sea as we drove. TIP: Bring binoculars with you to see them better.\n\nHEARST CASTLE (Simeon)\nWe did not have time to do the tour but stopped at the visitor's centre and had something to eat and use toilets. It is somewhere I would like to visit properly another time for a look.\n\nELEPHANT SEAL BEACH\nWe came across this large lay-by/ rest area as we drove from Simeon to Morro Bay. It is busy with tourists stopping because of the presence of very large seals on the beach. It is definitely worth stopping and not to be missed. Just by lying there the seals are incredibly entertaining and fascinating to watch and made us laugh a lot. My children loved them.\n\nSANTA BARBARA\nDelights;mAt last some heat and sunshine!! I finally took off my fleece.\nWe stayed in the Fess Parker Hilton Hotel on the beach-front. Not cheap but I loved this hotel because of its very spacious room, ocean-front location and swimming pool and jacuzzi which were open until 11pm.\n\nTip for hotel: join Hilton Rewards scheme and then wifi is free at Hilton Hotels otherwise they charge.\nWe had a morning run along the fabulous beach path every day ( the lifeguards go for their run too so it's a bit like Baywatch!)and we enjoyed the walk into town along it-about 20 minutes-every day. The car never moved.\n\nJust enjoy wandering this lovely town. Explore the harbour area, marina and beach front as well as State Street.\nWe loved hearing and seeing the train come through every day.\n\nToma's restaurant is a must if looking for a top notch meal. The scallops were amazing!\n\nDisappointments;\nCar Parking charge at hotel $19 per day.\nHotel could have been cleaner.\n\nWe heard the amphibious bus is really good but missed the last run of the day so did not get to do it. Never got round to seeing the courthouse either. Something for another visit perhaps.\n\nLOS ANGELES\ndelights;\nUniversal Studios-My kids thought the entire experience was one of their best days ever.The studio tour was amazing. Our favourite family ride was Jurassic Park water ride, especially the 84 ft drop at the end.\nThe Hogwarts Harry Potter ride was incredible but made us all a bit queezy! The waterworld show was brilliant as was special effects show.\n\nWe stayed at The Garland, North Hollywood- handy for Universal Studios; quirky, modern, clean rooms. Free trolley to Universal Studios. Expensive to eat in though.\n\nVivian's Millennium Cafe- excellent for breakfast. A short walk from the garland.\n\nSanta Monica Beach\nIconic location and Fun pier and beach. We had a ride on the Ferris Wheel and spent an afternoon on the beach. Amazing gymnastics park on the beach which my boys loved!\nVenice Beach- a quick visit for the experience.\nWe took a drive around Hollywood Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive.\n\nDisappointments:\nHollywood Boulevard was tacky.\n\nEating in at Garland Hotel-RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE. By far the most expensive meal of our entire trip (and by far not the best). A shame really.\n\nDELIGHTS OF LOS ANGELES TO SAN DIEGO\nWe drove through downtown LA to Long Beach and explored the beautiful area. The Queen Mary is now moored there and Long Beach is lovely. Could have spent much longer here but short of time.\n\nHuntingdon Beach ( known as Surf City).\nWe stopped where all the surfers were and spent an afternoon on the beach. The waves were huge. My kids loved it. Well worth doing for a chill out afternoon. Good shopping here too!\n\nSAN DIEGO\nDelights:\nThis is now one of my favourite cities. I loved it and it's not to be missed. Incredible harbour front and endless marinas and views. Nice downtown area too.\nWatching baseball at Petco Park is worth-while doing. The kids had fun.\nHighlight for us was the USS Midway Aircraft Carrier. Awesome day out for the entire family.\nWe stayed at Bahia Resort at Mission Bay. It was an Idyllic location. The hotel had its own paddle steamer to take guests across the beautiful lagoon. Free parking/Wifi. Rooms were a little tired and outdated though.\nAirport bizarrely in the downtown area so very convenient and quick to get to.\nDisappointment-our holiday had come to its end!

I will discuss the outline of our trip, where we stayed and places we visited. Each individual location will also be reviewed individually.\n\nWe started our trip in San Francisco (SF). We stayed at the Holiday Inn Civic Center because of it's central location. While conveniently located right off Market Street (SoMo), this hotel is not in a desirable neighborhood. Thank goodness for Uber. While in San Fran we visited Golden Gate Park. The park is HUGE! We searched for Hippie Hill (google it) and wandered around a bit. It's a lovely park but all attractions cost money to get into. That same evening we took an Uber to Crissy Field. Before going in, we walked through the Palace of Fine Arts (a beautiful architectural feature worth a peak). From Crissy Field in Presidio Park we strolled along the trail all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge. We took this walk about 3 hours before sunset and had plenty of time to walk up to an under the bridge. It is a lengthy walk, but totally worth it with hidden gems along the path. You can walk up onto the GG Bridge, although we did not. We did not walk all the way back, rather picked up an Uber by the welcome center. Visiting the Presidio is a MUST do in SF. BEWARE- SF is very chilly, especially along the water and as the sun sets.\n\nNext up in SF the cable car. I would HIGHLY recommend this although the wait from Market Street is long. We waited about an hour and a half in the afternoon. We took the Powell and Hyde Street car which takes you right between Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Square. You will pass by Lombard Street on this line. If you take this line, it is best to sit on the right hand side of the cable car for the best views. Fisherman's Wharf is VERY crowded and a complete tourist trap, but whatever, check it out anyway. From there we did a tour of Alcatraz. This is another MUST! We did the evening tour which advertises as an \"adult\" cruise. There were kids on it. I don't really know what was different from the tour except that your time is more limited.\n\nSince our goal was to see the Pacific Coast Hwy, we rented a camper van from Lost Campers USA (review upcoming/google them). The van had everything we needed for 3 nights of camping except for food and beverages.\n\nWe left SF with Monterey as our destination. You DO NOT need to take the PCH- Hwy 1 as there is nothing to see. But you also may want to avoid the 101, it is a parking lot. Trust me. We stopped at the Monterey Aquarium. It was a Saturday so it was super crowded. Overall, I was underwhelmed by the aquarium and Monterey.\n\nFrom Monterey we were headed to Big Sur to camp for 2 nights. About 20 minutes or so into our drive we happened upon a restaurant right off of the PCH called Rocky Point Restaurant. Turn here! Spectacular views and excellent food with reasonable prices. From there we headed to our camping destination Fernwood Resort. This privately owned campground is located right next to Pfieffer Big Sur State Park. We took the opportunity to hike Buzzard's Roost to the peak of a mountain. It is a difficult 5 mile round trip hike, but certainly doable. There is allegedly a panoramic view of the ocean at the top but we were unable to see it due to the daily marine haze that exists in the area. I would recommend taking any hikes, etc, after 12 when the haze lifts. There are redwood trees along the path as Big Sur is the southern most area for Redwoods in Ca.\n\nLeaving our camp ground, we stopped at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park in Big Sur. This is a very popular attraction as the McWay Falls trail is here. STOP HERE! This very short walk on the right side of the PCH traveling south is absolutely stunning.\n\nThis is where the PCH becomes what you expect. All along the route there are numerous points to pull off and view the virgin coast. You could literally stop every few yards, it's that gorgeous. Take your time, stop and just be present. It is so rare to see such natural beauty. Beware, there are not a lot of places to stop and any places there are will be CRAZY expensive! So have the supplies and gas you need to get you through the Big Sur region.\n\nOur next destination as Morro Bay about a 3 hour drive. We did it in 5 because of a few stops. We stopped in San Simeon and walked out on the pier. It's a nice area. Maybe stop and have some lunch. We found a great Mexican restaurant in the area. There are many \"touristy\" places to stop such as Elephant Seal Park and Hearst Castle. We didn't do these. We did stop at Moonstone Beach which was pretty cool.\n\nIn Morro Bay we stayed at Morro Strand RV Park (no tent camping). It is in a cute little town and the park was about 2 blocks away from the beach. We were able to sit on the beach and watch the sunset.\n\nOff to LA next to see friends. If it wasn't for our friends, I could have skipped LA, but we did stop through Santa Barbara on the way for some local brew and wine. In LA we went to Venice Beach and saw the skate park and muscle beach. It was interesting.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing trip, and if you have the time and desire, I would camp my way down the PCH. It makes you feel a part of the natural beauty of the environment.\n\nIt is good to have a plan with ideas of stops and travel time. But just as important is to be open to stopping and exploring.
