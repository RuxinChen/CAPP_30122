Private parties are reserved through the San Francisco City Parks and Recreation Department. Because it is a public place, the wedding ceremony is not private and anyone can walk by. The area of the actual ceremony is marked as private, but visitors can see the wedding taking place from a short distance away. Everyone passing by was very respectful and it really was nice to have unknown visitors enjoy the beautiful ceremony. We had chairs to sit on and although amplifiers are not allowed, the violin/cello duet, who were hired for the processional and recessional, was easily heard, as was the officiant and the speakers in the ceremony. It felt very private. The location is under the rotunda, which is a magnificent structure.\n\nThere is a lake in the park with birds and turtles and fishes. It is a very beautiful setting. On one side, along the outermost path surrounding the Park, the Golden Gate Bridge can be seen.\n\nThere is an enclosed building that was formerly an attraction, but now only holds some indoor children's games, and has a large coffee kiosk seating area to rest from being outdoors. There are very clean restrooms available in this building as well.\n\nIt does get windy in this area, so be sure to bring a jacket with you even if the day is otherwise warm. It is a chilly kind of wind, so you will be glad to have something warm to put on.\n\nAs with all outdoor venues for weddings, weather can always be a surprise. We had a bit of rain in a week that had been sunny every day! So that is my only caveat about choosing this as a venue for a wedding or other ceremony. The rain and chilly wind did not dampen the joy of the wedding one bit; it's simply something one must plan on and be prepared to accept. Mother Nature always has the upper hand.\n\nThe great structures and beautiful lake make excellent photography opportunities. The photo I am attaching to this review was taken with my basic cell phone, so you can imagine what great photos more advanced cameras will take.\n\nThe Parks and Recreation staff were very nice and professional and helped keep things flowing. I highly recommend hiring them to help with any event you book. You never know what may come up and it's well worth the peace of mind to have these friendly and knowledgeable people helping on your big day, no matter the occasion.\n\nEnjoy this attraction just for strolling, photo taking, or for your own big event!
