You can purchase tickets online or on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis on the day of your adventure. If you purchase online, make sure you print out or download the tickets before arriving as there is no cell service. Also, arrive 45 minutes before your departure time as you need to allow for parking and getting in the departure area ten minutes before your scheduled time. You enter on an access road, pay $5.00 for parking and are assigned a lot. A shuttle bus takes you to the tram building. Make sure you have winter clothes (jacket, warm shoes, gloves, hat, etc). There can easily be a 40 degree change in the temperature from the bottom to the top. The trip takes about ten minutes and the floor rotates 360 degrees. However, do position yourself by a window so your view is not obstructed. There are lots of decks at the top if you do not feel like hiking. We took the loop Desert Valley 1.5 mile trail. It has five \u201cnotches\u201d for magnificent views. Although, this is a \u201ceasy\u201d trail, you walk downhill to it, and navigate many rocks. My fitness tracker showed a total of fifty flights of stairs. It took about an hour to walk the trail and stop for pictures. After our hike, We enjoyed a bowl of chili in the cafeteria restaurant. There is also a bar and a waiter served restaurant at the top. You may have a brief wait to descend, depending on crowds and the tram schedule.

The tram ride itself was amazing with a rotating floor that makes two full revolutions during the trip up and again back down. This gives you a chance to see from all angles. Once at the top we followed one of the trails that was about a mile loop. It led to some incredible views of the desert valley below. It was in the low 70s at the desert when we entered the tram and in the low 40s at the top/in the forest - so be prepared for this. There were some spots of snow and ice (med Feb) and we saw more than one person slip as they adventured away from the main trail looking for better views or taking pictures. This crisp mountain air was quite refreshing. But mostly, I cannot adequately describe the incredible views from various spots along the trail.

It's even more strenuous hiking back up, should only be attempted by serious hikers or the very most physically fit. You could spend all day here, but some people just hit the highlights in and the building on top. We had to wait 1 1/2 hours for the tram ride up and about 20 minutes for the tram down. Often long waits going up and coming down on weekends and during peak hours. Try scheduling your trip early morning on a weekday for the smallest crowds and shortest lines.\nThe tram itself is one of the longest and highest trams in the world. It's a rotating tram, rotating more than 2 times during the one way quick trip. It's a little tricky to keep your balance in the outside row when going over the 4 towers since the swings and the outside handrails keeps moving and the floor moves too. It's much easier to ride in the interior rows where the handrails are stationary and goes the same speed as you.\nIt's really a valuable experience that I recommend you go if you can afford it.

Begin your ride at the Valley Station (elevation 2,643 feet) and end at the Mountain Top Station (elevation 8,516 feet). Such amazing panoramic jaw-dropping views await you on your informative 360 degree journey to the top, as you learn the immense undertaking that went into the construction of this Palm Springs marvel. Be sure to bring adequate and correct clothing as the temperature is 20 to 30 degrees cooler at the higher altitude. At the top, there are also shops and restaurants and various things to do as well as numerous hiking trails of varying lengths for the eager adventurers. So give yourself plenty of time to experience the wonderment of this Palm Springs jewel. Then when you are ready to return simply hop on the next available tram back down, which run regularly every 20 to 30 minutes.

But, I doubt they would bring vicious animals within close proximity to people if they were apt to bite, else they be sued. I have a Boxer. They are the most gentle of dogs, and are excellent with small children and even babies. However, Boxers are also very lively. I would want to take my boxer for the simple fact that she is for all intents and purposes my daughter. She is losing her eyesight and doesn't like being left behind or alone. I have a chronic life-threatening illness, which is a matter between my doctor and myself. It is actually illtegal, for example, to ask a person parking in a handicap space with a placard or plate what their disability is. So, I can understand why it isn't yours or anyone else's business why they require a \"service\" animal. You are thinking \"service animal\" means they are trained to help you cross the street, or to fetch you a beer from the refrigerator; when in fact, they can be of service merely by existing and being close. For instance, when I get angry at the insanity that is our news every day, and if I yell at the tv or computer, my dog doesn't run and hide, she comes running to me. She promptly sits down next to me and looks over her shoulder at me suggesting that I pet her to calm down. When I had cancer on my leg, she examined it every single day until I was well-- although she does sniff my right eye, never my left, when I put my face up to hers... tumor? Because she is large, and because I'm not crazy, I do not take her to places such as the pharmacy or the grocery store; but the LOVE her at Lowes and Home Depot. I dont take her to the pet shops because, although I trust her, I do not trust other people's large dogs from past experiences from having owned 3 boxers over the years-- my dogs have been attacked without provocation on four separate instances.

Views are spectacular and food and drink available."], ["Reviewed January 10, 2018", 3.0, "Disappointed", "I was expecting an experience akin to Table Mountain in Cape Town or the trams at Sugarloaf and Corcavada in Rio. Not even close.\nViews in tramcar obscured by grabrails and sashes, the view is quite distant to the town, and you have to exit to the outside deck in high winds for a decent view.\nOK just not great.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 10, 2018", 5.0, "Just do it!", "A spectacular 10 minute ride up a steep cliff in a gondola that revolves so everyone gets great views on the trip (it revolves twice on the journey) to a breathtakingly beautiful national park at the top. There are routes for everyone whether you just want a stroll and some views or some serious hiking. The landscape is pristine and the air is so clean. Just make sure you get there early as it gets busy as the day goes on.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 9, 2018", 5.0, "Nice hike", "We took the tram without reservations. We easily got an 1120 spot and did a beautiful almost 5 mile hike. Because of our timeframe we opted to eat at the sit down restaurant it was fabulous! The homemade vegetable beef soup was perfect seasoned well. My husband and I had wedge salad also perfectly balanced w right any of dressing. Our kids had turkey avocado clubs.

Overall very disappointing.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 9, 2018", 5.0, "Always Exciting", "Having been up before, this time I have to say, it was just as exciting to ride the tram.

Get your tickets in advance for the specific time. Give yourselves some time for parking from there buses will take you to the tramway every 5 to 10 minutes. If you have tickets, stay to the right on the stairs and go to the cafe or boarding area. If you don't have tickets get in the line to the left (sometimes starts all the way from the stairs). make sure only one person is standing in line for tickets. others can hang out at the cafe or boarding area. I think the tram ride itself is a bit overrated as I have gone in many cable car rides before in Quito, Swiss, Hong Kong, Rio.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 8, 2018", 4.0, "Great Scenery", "We did the Tram twice - each time was a different experience.

There was absolutely no communication from the staff at the top as to why we had to wait 2 hours for a tram down the hill. Things happen and if we had gotten an explanation (i.e. power trouble, or heavy winds are slowing us down) that would have gone a long way. However, we were kept in long lines and then once in the holding area, still kept uninformed as to when the next tram would arrive. I would recommend asking before you board the UP tram as to what the travel down time is... if our ticket seller had mentioned the long delay, we would have chosen not to go up, as we missed our dinner engagement due to the long wait at the top.\nShow less"]]}}
