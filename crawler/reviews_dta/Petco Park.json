However, this was a really enjoyable and fun night out. The atmosphere is fun and safe for families. We went to a Padres v Detroit Tigers game and the stand contained both sets of fans, who were very friendly towards each other.\nMy first tip is to book your tickets in advance via the Padres website, it's really user friendly and you can choose your seats via a stadium map. If you are not a big fan I would also recommend that you choose cheap seats. We sat on the front row of section 350, which were amongst the cheapest seats available. It was high up but diectly above the diamond, so it afforded us an excellent view of the action and the whole stadium. We were fully involved in the atmosphere of the crowd and the game.\nMy second tip is to use public transport if you can as the traffic is very busy at game time and the parking cost me $20.\nPicking up you tickets from the ticket office is very easy and there are lots of stewards who will guide you on where to go. There are security checks before entering the gound and even though the queues were long, we moved through fairly quickly. Once inside there are lots of stewards to guide you to your seat.\nI would recommend that you don't eat before you go as we found the food stands to be reasonably priced and plentiful.\nIf you are a Brit and not sure whether to go I would stongly recommend that you do, it's a great experience - go to a game, get a hot dog and buy a cap ($25).
