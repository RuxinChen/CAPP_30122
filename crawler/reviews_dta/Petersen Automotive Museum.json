Visitors get to ogle the outsides of automobiles as well as the inside. The choice to feature a section on the design of automobiles (and a chance to watch actual designers in action), as well as taking an in depth look at development of a car, is a nice touch. The exhibit for the movie Cars is fun, and possibly the most kid-friendly section of the museum. I do wish the museum took greater efforts to explain some of their interactive exhibits so you could decide if it was something worth waiting in line for. When I went, there was a section that seemed like a video game and people sitting to wait their turn to be escorted into the back video game section. I can't say for sure if this was the case because there was very little signage or information about it in the museum map. Museum personnel were busy with other visitors. I have no idea if I missed out on something fun.\n\nThe museum does a nice job of providing phone charging cords at many outlets. Look for a bench to sit on and it probably has a phone charger nearby. The size of the museum was easily manageable; bathrooms and drinking fountains were easy to find and get to without having to snake through a warren of galleries.

Definitely worth a visit if you care at all about cars", "The Petersen was a late add to our Los Angeles itinerary -- we decided to visit on a whim on the last day of our long weekend trip. All I can say is, wow!\n\nMy first key piece of advice: do the vault tour. It is an extra add-on to the ticket, but that's where many of the goodies are -- an odd combination of unique custom cars, cars relevant to automotive history (think Tucker, DeLorean, Tesla, Model T), and cars relevant to world history (limos of FDR, Saddam Hussein, Marcos, etc.) In the vault tour, you walk through an unadorned basement garage with one interesting vehicle after another. It is surprisingly long at 90+ minutes, so eat some food and use the bathroom in advance. The docent who led the tour was outstanding.\n\nThe rest of the museum is very interesting as well, but the vault was the capstone, I wasn't sure what was permanent display and what was special exhibition, but we saw an exhibit of Ferraris, an exhibit of cars from movies and TV (e.g, Magnum PI's Ferrari, the DeLorean from Back to the Future, the T-Bird from Thelma and Louise, etc.), and a Bugatti exhibit, among others.\n\nI suppose some love of automobiles is important to having a good experience, but if you care at all about cars, this is a must-see destination.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 31, 2017", 5.0, "If you love cars this is a cant miss experience.", "The Petersen Automotive Museum is an amazing place.

They have a kids area that is more hands on but I loved that area too as an adult.\nWe passed on the restaurant. It didn't have a lot of space and seemed pricey. I have no clue if the food was any good though.\nTip: Don't bring a backpack. They won't let you bring it in. Instead they will have you check it in at the desk, but really it would be easier if you left it at home.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 31, 2017", 5.0, "Has everything with a motor", "A car buff will really enjoy this museum.
