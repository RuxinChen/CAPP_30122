At the beach, i made the mistake thinking that the first rock was the main one with the opening, but it is the second one that is it. Everything is great about the beach as others have reviewed. There are 2 parking lots, a closer one that is a loop and an upper lot. I just parked in the upper and walked to avoid the people waiting for spots at the lower lot.\n\nLet's talk about the one lane road that leads to the beach. It is narrow. There are blind turns. It is bumpy at times. Please have courtesy and do not tail gate. I had another car tail gate me from the start up at highway 1. I went as fast as I cautiously could with the bumps and curves, but he was on my tail the whole time. About half way down, I pulled to the side to let another van pass coming up. He tried to get around me, but then saw the van and slammed on his brakes and had to reverse back up. I think that gave him a hint. He was better the rest of the way. I went into the upper lot and he sped past to the lower lot. When we were leaving he was somehow behind me again, but this time he wised up. He kept a safe distance and just let me go at it at my pace.\n\nIt is easier to see ahead on the way out of the beach than on the way to it, in my opinion. Please turn your lights on. It really helps as I would look through the trees up ahead to see if there were any lights coming.\n\nAll in all, you gotta check the place out.

Google maps worked for us to find the right spot. The road down to it was a bit rough--slow down along the 1 as you come up to it, because it's easily missable. It's 1.5 lanes wide, so be prepared to pull over to let people pass, there are no lines or reflectors and no lights, which makes navigating it at night a bit more difficult than usual. Just when you think you might turn around, because really, it seems pretty creepy, you reach the main parking lot. The lot isn't large, but a couple of people were leaving when we got there. We were there just before Thanksgiving, so with the wind, it was chilly--bring a fleece and windbreaker! But that also meant people typically didn't seem to stay more than 20-30 minutes (so pull over and wait for a parking spot). You walk a couple of blocks-worth across mostly flat sand, and if you go at sunset, you'll see the jaw dropping beauty of the sun about to come through the main arch.

I didn't note any waste though, so thank you for picking up after them!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed March 26, 2016", 4.0, "It's true! There is purple sand!", "I was very skeptical about seeing purple sand, but we saw it. Now, the entire beach is not purple, but there truly is some purple sand. The turnoff to get to the beach is very hard to see but I took a quick picture of the entrance right after we turned off the highway to show you. The name of the road is Sycamore Canyon Road. Also, it's a very narrow 2 miles to get to the parking lot and you are wondering at times where in the world you are going! But that made for the adventure of getting there and a more exciting trip. Parking is limited but we were able to find a spot. The restrooms have no running water but are clean, A quick hike on a well marked trail and we were there. I'm glad we took the time to find this gem. Note: I believe your pass to this park gets you in to other state parks so keep that in mind if you are planning to stop at other spots along the coast!\nShow less"]]}}
