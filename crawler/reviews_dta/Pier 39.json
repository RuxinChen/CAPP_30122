Every shop sells junk and trinkets you could buy at home for 1/4th the price. The public restrooms on the Embarcadero are unsafe, filthy bum housing. So called \"street performers\" are pretty lame and in the end are just beggars, sanctioned by the City. If you don't give them money, prepare to be rudely berated. Restaurants serve barely average food at inflated prices because of the location. You will need to buy several meals a day to use a presentable restroom. Also- the communist City of SF charges an extra 4% surcharge on top of the highest state tax in the nation to provide medical care to the bums- so plan on that added expense. If you want to visit any of the special area attractions, bring a stack of $100 bills. Every attraction has a high entry fee ranging from $20 to step foot on the WWII supply ship or sub (that's $20 EACH) and on up from there. Oh ya- parking will set you back another $50 and the City gridlock is the worst you will see, anywhere in the world. Last warning- If you want to visit Alcatraz, this is where you catch the only ferry. Buy your tickets online in advance. It is unlikely you will be able to just show up and have a vacancy.

Aquarium of the Bay is here. Lots of restaurants - above as well as on the ground level. Touristy shopping- lots of knick-knacks. Views of Alcatraz from several eateries. And don't forget the Sea Lions at the very end around the corner. Loads of fun.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 17, 2018", 4.0, "The tourist place on the bay", "This is where you get full on everything that is for the vistor.

Shopping, eateries, souvenirs, aquarium and street performers.\nThey seemed to have upgraded and remodeled since my last visit. It was clean and well maintained.\n\nParking near pier is available.\nMake sure to go the end of the pier so that you can see the sealife that is basking in the sun on the docks.

They also house a lot of restaurants (Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba Gump, Fog Breath )and other eateries, clothing stores and even experience rides. We didn\u2019t realise till we went exploring further in that this place is actually really quite extensive. Fun for us who like mooching around different shops.

This was so full of life and colors! Wonderful shops and great eateries. We loved Bubba Gumps, but there were lots of places. I enjoyed walking along the waterfront. The BEST part was seeing the seals! Loved watching and hearing them!!! Such a lively bunch!!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 14, 2018", 5.0, "One of my Favorites", "This place is a blast. Definitely a tourist stop, and has a little bit of everything. You can catch a boat tour, see the sea lions outside the docks, ride the carousel, or get a meal. There are plenty of high end restaurants, and well as chain restaurants (like Bubba Gump Shrimp, where we ate). There are also a few gift shops, where you can find anything you could imagine to remember your trip. This would be a place we go to every time we are in town.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 14, 2018", 4.0, "It is a mall", "They basically transformed the pier into a mall.

Can accommodate varying budgets as it\u2019s the kind of place where you can spend as much or as little as you want. Spent an afternoon here watching free performances and wandering in and out of souvenir shops. Had a nice day. The information centre was really helpful. Take a walk to see the sea lions. Apparently it\u2019s hit and miss as to how many you will see but on the day we visited, there were loads and they are highly entertaining. Quite a few places to eat varying in price and cuisine. Tried the aqua massage where you remain fully clothed. Looks similar to a capsule where you\u2019re encased in what looks like plastic sheeting. Headphones are provided as head remains visible. Jets massage from neck to feet. Recommend.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 13, 2018", 1.0, "Didn\u2019t rate it", "Nothing really of interest. Couple of okay souvenier shops.
