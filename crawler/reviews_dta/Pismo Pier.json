I'm forced to put a specific month that I was there to visit so I will select December because I doubt that is the common month to leave a review, but the truth is I have been to this location many many times, and at all times of the year. I currently live about 6 hours away, but I grew up about 20min from Pismo Beach and the Pier is very familiar to me. I have even jumped off the end of the Pier into the open waters several times over the course of my life, however I do not recommend anyone else do it or indorse jumping off Pier in any form, it's very dangerous so DO NOT JUMP OFF THE END OF THE PIER.

We walked to the pier and down to the beach to enjoy the view. There are lots of shops and restaurants nearby. The beach was clean and easy to access. There were also showers to rinse off afterward which was nice.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 26, 2016", 3.0, "Beautiful Views of the Ocean and Surfers", "I love walking the Pier and looking at the Ocean, the Surfers, the people and kids on the beach and in the water. Dogs also were on leashes and off on the beach. Not too sure I liked that idea! Fun to watch though. You can actually walk to the end of the Pier and be walking with the ocean underneath you. I LIKE TO FIND A BENCH AND AND WATCH THE SURF . The waves breaking are mezmerising. It is very meditative. It made me want to just look and pray. Gorgeous place to veg out! It is the longest Pier in Ca.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 22, 2016", 4.0, "Nice walk", "Wandered down the pier before setting off to LA.
