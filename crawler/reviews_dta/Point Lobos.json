The purpose of a reserve is to forever protect an area of unique natural beauty and ecological significance.\n\nThis is a magic place just south of Carmel. There are several self guided and guided walks available. I recommend one that starts at Whalers Cabin. It\u2019s not offered every day. There\u2019s a link to a schedule at the Point Lobos Foundation website.\n\nHints:\nParking is at a premium on weekends and during summer breaks. You can park alongside Hwy 1 but to park inside the preserve plan to arrive before 9:00 am or you\u2019ll probably have up to a mile walk. Off season midweeks shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\nDress warmly in layers.

It is such a popular photograph spot that College photography school come to this place as a class project.\n\nYou keep walking on the cypress grove trail past the Pinnacle Cove, you would reach the mystique Cypress Cove, it resembles a movie set from Peter Pan.\n\nIf you go to the other side onto Sea Lion Trail, you can often see sea lions waddling in the water. The steps down to the beach is steep , care should be taken with younger children.\n\nThere are cormorants nested on the cliff edges.

But that was an all day affair with several stops to just sit and watch. We are in our upper 60s so it is all very walkable.

The place is magic and beautiful whether its sunny or cloudy (though we prefer it sunny). The walking is mostly flat and easy to the south with more hills to climb to the north. But the hills are not that steep. For those who can't walk much, you can simply park and walk a few hundred feet and just take in the view. There are friendly and knowledgeable docents there to answer your questions. There are also a modest number of picnic spots. There's scuba diving there, too, if that's what your into, but I don't know what kind of permits or reservations are needed.
