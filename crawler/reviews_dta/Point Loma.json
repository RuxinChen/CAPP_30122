The view is amazing anytime of day but make the effort to literally plan your days schedule around it to arrive by 5pm and prepare for the sunset experience of your life. NOTE: go up to the lighthouse first and enjoy the view and then travel back down the hill a bit to the overview before the gate area. We were irritated that the upper level state park actually CLOSED just before sunset and staff was shuffling us out before we could enjoy it completely.

We even climbed down to what I thought would be a bunk room, but it not only held sleeping quarters, but also the area where sailors took turns watching for incoming enemies.
