They, along with the Presidio Trust and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservatory have rehabilitated & restored the buildings, grounds and forest areas which make up the Presidio.\nDuring WWII, the Americans of Japanese ancestry were \"relocated (moved)\" from their homes in No. Calif. to \"Relocation Camps\" out of the West Coast into camps as far as Arkansas. There were 10 or15 such camps around the country and most were in the barren and desert area of those states.This was under the order of Lt. Gen. J.L. DeWitt, head of the Army's Western Defense Command. He issued the \"Civilian Exclusion Order\" incarcerating over 110,000 Americans of Japanese decent to these camps. It's a \"shameful period\" in our history for which the history books devote a page or a half a page to this event. The order was challenged in the Supreme Court with the famous case of Korematsu vs. the United States. He along with two(2) other Japanese-Americans, who joined him in the \"lawsuit\" and won their case.\nThe exhibit of the Japanese-American \"Exclusion Art\" is very \"moving, poignant and heartbreaking\" story on to how they were treated based on their ancestry and yet, being born American. It also tells in part the story of the all \"Nisei\" 442nd. Infantry, the most decorated unit in WWII, and their heroic efforts during that war. Just to show/prove that they were\" Americans\" and would fight for their country! You will come away with your own impressions and thought \"of then and now\"! The exhibit is presented by the Fred T. Korematsu Foundation and the National Japanese American Historical Society, both of them housed there in the Presidio.\nThey have a restaurant in the club and which is reasonable. There is \"free entrance\" to the exhibit and there's also, \"free parking\" in front, on the parade grounds.\nEnjoy the history and the exhibits at the \"O\" Club in the Presidio.

We quickly realized that there were many possibilities for enjoying the Presidio, which is only about 1/4 mile from where we were staying. The first trip to the Presidio, we followed advice from a cycling-route website and took Mountain Lake Trail west for a mile or so, then went up a steep hill through a golf course to get to Washington Blvd, which winds through eucalyptus trees over toward the Golden Gate Bridge. The trail is charming, full of dog walkers and runners and people taking their constitutionals. People readily helped us figure out the best route to the bridge, and it was a pleasant run down hill (til we got to the steep bit). Washington Blvd is popular with bikers, who led the way to the bridge's pedestrian and cycling lanes. We ended up going back and forth through the Presidio several times (sometimes using Arguello Avenue, sometimes Mountain Lake Trail): we rode to Marin county 5 times, and we also took a route down Veteran's Boulevard to Baker's Beach and the outer Richmond District, and another route right through the center of this former Army post to get to Crissy Field and the Marina. It's a delight to ride in the Presidio, with gentle well-graded roads for the most part and fabulous views of the Golden Gate Bridge, the Marin headlands, the Richmond, the Marina, Alcatraz, and Baker's Beach, This area seemed very bicycle-friendly to us, with clearly marked bike lanes and good signage.

I am prejudiced since I live very close to the Presidio and visit a couple of times a week. But for tourists this is one of the more unknown treasures of our city.\n\nThe terrain is much more rugged than Golden Gate Park so wear comfortable hiking shoes and be prepared for hills. Because of those hills I hesitate to recommend biking thru here unless you are in good shape.\n\nThere are fewer eating options than in and around Golden Gate Park. And fewer water fountains so bring a water bottle. There are a few restaurants in the Presidio so if you look at a map you can plan your day to start or finish at a nice eatery.\n\nThere are sweeping vistas of the Bay, tree lined trails and interesting locales spread throughout this treasure box of a park. The National Cemetery and Walt Disney Museum to name two contrasting locations. If you want to see a lot of different places in one trip, then you can drive. But this is really a walker's kind of trip.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 24, 2017", 4.0, "Historic Park with military history", "Very nice place for a walk around in the sunshine the park has attractions also museums lot of history here"], ["Reviewed May 23, 2017", 5.0, "Worth a wander", "Stunning view of the Golden Gate Bridge.
