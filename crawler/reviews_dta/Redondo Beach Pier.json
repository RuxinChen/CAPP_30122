It is a wonder place to walk around and admire the ocean. Sunset is my favorite time to be down here, but anytime is a good time. The weekends are obviously busier but parking is usually no problem.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed December 1, 2016", 4.0, "Great vistas!", "Well-maintained, clean with plenty to seating.

Very quiet, not at all busy between 1100 and 1400. Bonus was the warm weather, ocean breeze and the sound of the waves crashing on the rocks. Some of the restaurants opened after 1200, most had sea food offerings. Overall a good location to relax and enjoy the view.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 15, 2016", 4.0, "Great views", "Nice to walk through , with fantastic ocean views , pleasant walking and lots to see , great for the kids to wander through the shops and view the ocean"], ["Reviewed November 15, 2016", 4.0, "Worth a visit", "Nice pier without all the hustle and bustle of the some of the other ones close by.

There are plenty of shops to go to and the fresh seafood restaurant choices are plentiful.\n\nI ate at Quality Seafood, Inc. and was a little bit disappointed. First of all, the person behind the counter was rude and gave me conflicting information in terms of how they prepare and clean the fish compared to what the cashier told me. The man acted as if I was bothering him for asking him to clean-up and cook the seafood I had ordered from this joint. Then they overcooked/overfried my fish and my calamari and there was no seasoning at all. I should have walked a little bit further and gone to Captain Kidds Fish Market instead, which was the place that was recommended to me by one of my girlfriends who went there recently. I'll make sure not to buy my seafood and eat at this Quality Seafood, Inc. again. I've been in Customer Service industry for over 18 years and I've always treated my customers happily with a smile. Not once in my work history have I treated a customer as if they were a nuissance.\n\nAt the end of my meal, I walked-off all that seafood that I ate and watched the sunset. As always, the sunset was gorgeous and loved the silhouette of the pier lights and the people fishing. I was so bummed that my phone battery died and was unable to take photos *sigh*.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 31, 2016", 4.0, "Great place to walk, shop, nosh and enjoy the ocean views", "We spent a weekday afternoon walking on the Redondo Beach Pier. While it wasn't packed with tourists, it still had a large selection of arcades and shops as well as all kinds of snacks for sale. The best part was that you could enjoy the incredible views of the Pacific Ocean and if you were inspired you could rent a kayak or a paddle boat and get in the water!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 29, 2016", 5.0, "Great Place!", "The Pier is so wonderful for a walk!
