In Mondavi i was received in an office with a check in desk where i waited for 5 mins before being acknowledged.\n\nIn the small winery the sommelier established a rapport with us to find out which wines we were probably going to like and which we werent. In Mondavi our guide could barely be bothered to say hello let alone know our names.\n\nAlso in the small winery i had 5 dishes of fine food prepared by a top quality chef to go with about 9 different amazing wines. This also included top ups should i have wanted them. I probably drank the equivalent of a bottle.\n\nIn Mondavi I tasted 4 wines but in total had the equivalent of a small glass (125mls), and a single mouthful of chalupa.\n\nAt both wineries i had a tour of the grounds. The only difference is at Mondavi i got to visit the cellars whereas i didnt at the first winery.\n\nHowever price wise, at Mondavi I paid $40 in total whilst the smaller winery i paid $95 in total for everything (including the food).\n\nMy advice, pay extra and go small!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 1 week ago", 5.0, "Still Good After All These Years", "I used to live close to wine country and have done the wine train, the limo thing, and the couples thing.

The front grounds are beautiful with many visitors doing photos in front of the fountain.

Take a minute to look around.\nThe tasting room is nice but if weather permits, sit on the patio. More room, great view, fresh air, sunshine. Tasting flights vary from $25 up, depending on which one you order. In my opinion, a better deal is to take a tour, which will include some wine and sometimes some paired up snacks. You will learn and see quite a bit about how a winery operates, and be more into the wine.\nIf you are really into wine, sign up for the club.

The romantically beautiful setting of the Napa valley hills drew us in and the amazing high end tasting is was an unexpected treat. We had the privilege of having Eric guide us through the grounds and educate us on the history of the legendary Mondavi family estate. We did the garden tour which included five different t pairings and a personal chef. It was absolutely Devine. LOVED it!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 12, 2016", 5.0, "Like this place", "It is broad when you first see it, it gives you a comfort feeling that you will like it.
