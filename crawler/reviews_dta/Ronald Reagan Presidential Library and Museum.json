It is well designed and placed in a beautiful setting. Reagan in many ways represented the quintessential American Dream saga, coming out of modest circumstances to rise to the highest office in the land. As with most presidential libraries and museums, it does tend to gloss over the negative (Iran Contra comes to mind), but overall they do a good job.

They had a special Genghis Kahn exhibit that I wished I had skipped and gave myself more time in gift shop and outside. It was a well done exhibit, just not interested.

For example, \"The Trickle Down Theory\" of economics makes me sick just to contemplate the effect this theory had and is now having on people of modest means.

We toured the Library mid-November and mid-week when it was 72 degrees outside and very uncrowded. First of all, the views from the Library to the hills of Simi Valley are stunning. There are several spots where you could bring a picnic lunch if you were so inclined. The architecture of the building is fabulous. As you enter the courtyard, it is a bit reminiscent of the California Mission at San Juan Capistrano. But when you get to Air Force One, the architecture is quite modern, with the plane elevated and facing toward windows that face the mountains such that it looks like it is ready to take off in flight. I did not find the admission fee to be expensive for what you experience--and you can shop around for savings. At the time we went, Costco had admission for two that included audio and also entrance to the Titanic exhibit for $50 for two. You can buy regular admission online or in person. We bought in person because buying online asked for your time of arrival, and since we were coming from San Diego, we didn't know when we would arrive. The line for prepurchased tickets was longer than the line for purchasing on the spot, although neither line was more than 5 minutes. The exhibits are very well done and give a very honest perspective of the man and his values. I knew most of the information since I have lived in California all of my life and he was our Governor as well as our President. For the reviewers who feel this the library is propaganda of Reagan--I respectfully disagree. He became President when interest rates were 18%, jobs were scarce, inflation was rampant and the geopolitical scene was frightening. People were scared and pessimistic. When he came into office, inflation was over 12%, unemployment was 7.5% and the top tax rate was over $55%. When he left, inflation was about 4.5%, unemployment dropped over 2% and mortgage interest dropped from 15% to 10%. His free market policies worked at home, and his geopolitical policies worked outside the U.S. He was a very optimistic man despite governing during very trying times.\nThe Library houses some very interesting letters written by Reagan, that show that he was a clever writer as well as a great speaker. This shows that he wrote many of his own speeches. There are interactive exhibits where you can play an actor with him in a movie, delivering your own lines; or you can pick stocks during his reign and see how your portfolio did during his 8 years in office. The Library displays the suit he wore during his assassination attempt, as well as the gun Hinckley used. There is a lifesize replica of the oval office that is a few feet below the visitors. The docent explained that when Reagan saw the replica, he said it looked like the ceilings were not tall enough. Administrators called the Oval Office and asked for measurements and found that Reagan was correct, but they told him that they could not raise the ceiling because of permitting problems.\nHe said \"Start digging.\" (Which they did). The coup de gras is Air Force One that has a huge wingspan, since it is a 707. It looks like it has just been polished by hand. It was used by several Presidents--some after Reagan, so procuring it for this Library had to have been quite an accomplishment. There are several police cars, a limosine and Marine One (used by Johnson). I found all of these to be very interesting. We had lunch next to Air Force One at the Ronald Reagan Pub. It has self-service items. The wood inside the pub was transported from a pub in Ireland where Reagan visited his roots. When the Library was being built, a trustee learned that O'Farrell's Pub in Ballyporeen Ireland was recently permanently closed and the owner was going to sell the fixtures. The Library bought all of them--hence the Guiness advertisements and beer taps and gorgeous mahogany bar and barstools.\nOutside is a piece of the Berlin wall--stark concrete on the East German side and large pink flowers on the Western side. There is also a replica of the south lawn and the rose garden of the White House, as well as the memorial where both Nancy and Ronald Reagan are buried.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 16, 2017", 5.0, "Must see!", "Family road trip purpose to see Reagan Library Museum.
