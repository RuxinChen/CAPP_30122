Key things you need to know. Summer is hot. Remember tourists, it's a canyon and let me tell you the temperature will kick you and your dog. Take water bottles. You can fill them up at the base of the canyon but there is none at the top. I usually catch a ride there because parking can be killer. If you drive, start at the top. There's a nice lot, go early. At the base, they even have bottles for sale on good faith you will pay for them. There are dog treats and some fruit too. Take a couple of bucks you're good. There are two ways up the canyon either is fine. I prefer the left side up. I like the incline. Dogs can go without leashes once inside the canyon area. I have met many folks who are regulars and have given me insight on the Runyon dogs. There are definitely dogs that shouldn't be without a leash. They will be aggressive toward other dogs. (Let me be clear I've never seen nor heard of a dog biting anyone at the canyon). I have a pitbull. She's awesome. I take her and she is trained and on a security collar. Be aware of other dogs and keep your dog next to you when going near others. Most everyone is aclimated to dogs and is very tolerant until they aren't. Dog owners unite AND TAKE A POOP BAG. There usually is a dog waterbowel underneath the benches (right if you are facing the top) and nice views for a rest if too hot. On a beautiful day it's a spectacular view all around. Don't go if windy. The dust will be overwhelming. The canyon is dirt all the way on the trail. In most spots it's wide. One side (right if at base) is rocky and in some parts can be tricky to navigate if you are older or unstable on your feet. Never fails I hear of a celebrity in the canyon on the same day as me and yet never see anyone familiar. I will admit January is the best time to visit Runyon. Watch the weather and pick the perfect day, It will be cooler as you climb to the top so gently layer. I have never seen any wildlife but I'm really not complaining. I go to walk and see the views. It's a unique place. Canyons offer a vantage point to soak in the LA area. It's a great place to get a tast of LA. From runners to walkers, yoga classes at the base, trainers and lifters, everyone heads to Runyon. Sunset is spectacular. Highly recommend for those great outdoors folks and hikers.

Never mind that it destroyed what little semblance of nature was afforded by the old partially paved road. But asphalt? Doesn't last as long as concrete. Maybe the city wants the partially paved look back again, because that is what it's going to be come a dozen years or so.
