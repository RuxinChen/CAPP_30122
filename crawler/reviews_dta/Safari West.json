We were greeted by our tour guide and driver, Alex, and our giant, yellow, tour truck. The tour and Alex did not disappoint. He was knowledgeable and funny and kept all the guests engaged and entertained. The tour lasted around 2 1/2 hours and took us across the sprawling property.

My favorite part was the section when we came up to the zebras. They were so sweet and had such playful personalities. We also got the opportunity to get up very close to the \"puppy dogs\" of Safari West, a herd of Watusi cattle. Their large horns are, at first, intimidating, but with their docile nature, it was just impressive and beautiful to see them so up close. I had to neglect my inner 10-year old's urge to reach out and pet all of the animals we came into contact with.\n\nThis place may disappoint some who are looking to get so close to every animal that they too feel like they can reach out and touch them. Such expectations are just unreasonable. Also, this place is not a zoo or an actual African Safari. Spoiler alert, you are not going to see African animals wild in nature.

Saw lots of other cool animals including wildebeest, gazelles, ostriches, impala, antelope, and a bunch of others whose names I forget.

As I neared Santa Rosa, the car gauge stated 111\u00b0F and it felt like I was being sauteed every time I stepped outside. It didn't start to cool down until 9pm so stay properly hydrated and bring a spray bottle so you can cool down your skin.\n\nFirst up, the tents are adequately equipped with every amenity to be considered glamping. The beds are plush and area is clean and tidy. My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hillside tents which is pretty secluded and in front of a lake. Besides the occasional wildebeest mooing and guinea fowl calls, our tent was pretty intimate since it was pretty far from the entrance so there wasn't constant voices from guests and footsteps going back and forth to the cafe. It's about a 5 minute walk to the entrance or a 2 minute Jeep ride for the lazy. I highly recommend staying for at least a night to soak in the setting that Safari West put together. Note that there is no A/C available but there are heaters since it can get chilly at night.\n\nThe safari tour pretty much blew my expectations away. There is a general area for which guests can wander around and admire the animals for which I naively thought was the extent of the sights available for the tour. Turns out there are literally hundreds of gated acres in the back only accessible by safari jeeps and WAYYYY more exotic animals. Our tour guide, Jenna, was the kind of person you would love to kick back a beer with. She's a European chef by trade but comes back to Safari West every now and then to give these enthusiastic and informative tours. Jenna was able to answer every question, give interesting and concise facts about each animal, and read the crowd by telling hilarious jokes! Since there were no children in our tour group, Jenna went into the more \"R-rated\" characteristics or certain animals, and also gave a preview into Safari West Valentine's Day specials, which really livened up the tour. I would not hesitate to go on this tour again. It's a great day activity and honestly, the value of the tour way exceeds the price.\n\nWhether you're looking for an activity to do, booking a romantic getaway, or doing a family outing, Safari West checks off a lot of boxes. Everyone comes here for the African safari tour but don't ignore the overnight stay.

Maybe next time we'll spend the night.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 12, 2017", 5.0, "Safari West is an AMAZING Place to Visit", "When we went to Safari West we went on a safari ride in a real safari truck. Approximately 2 hours of riding and visiting all of the amazing animals (rhino's, zebra's, giraffe's, etc.). Our children loved them and there were certainly lots of oh's and ah's. It was well worth the money spent on this amazing adventure.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 12, 2017", 4.0, "Visiting With Teens", "1) The Safari Website shows an elephant - w the jeeps surrounded by giraffe walking freely - no encounters - a pre-warning for parents via email would eliminate disappointment .2) Our tent - had no hot water.3) The buffalo, elan, zebra, kudo etc herds were impressive and close by the jeeps - with the tour guide fun and upbeat and accommodating - great fun.4) the aviary and flamingo pond were spectacular, as were the two mini-fox (adorable) 5) The tortoises were very active (surprising) while the (old) cheetahs were reclusive.(6) The BBQ items were terrific, with the side dishes a bit on the starchy side but certainly delicious. (7) the caged wildlife should be placarded for those wanting to return and see them again. 8) the tent experience was wonderful for the teens albeit they needed to have bunks because they don't sleep together at home - not sure how many bunked tents you have...need more?Thank you!\nShow less"]]}}
