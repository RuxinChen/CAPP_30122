We were very excited about the safari park. I decided that we would pay to do the lion and friends encounter in hopes that we would get to see a few animals up close! It was totally worth the money! We were on a big golf cart with us and 3 other people! Our host took us behind the scenes through the Africa and Asia areas. I think the tram that's part of the admission only takes you through Africa. And the line for the trams was pretty long! I was able to take lots of great photos with my long lense camera. I'm glad we spent the extra money to do this. We didn't get close enough to feed any animals though, if you want to be able to feed the rhinos or giraffes you'll have to do the caravan tour. Our tour of the lands was about an hour and then we got out and we learned about the lions and got to see them pretty up close! We didn't get to touch them, but they were so close! We were able to get our water bottles refilled here too! After seeing the lions we got back on our golf cart and went to this animal care center and we got to touch and see some other animals really up close. We got to touch a hedgehog and saw a bird do some tricks and got to see a lot of other animals in their habitats. These animals are not out in the public to see so it was a great treat! Our party really enjoyed the experience.\n\nAfter our encounter we got dropped off and had lunch. We had lunch at Thorntree Terrace. The food here was pretty good. We got a couple of burgers and a couple of rice bowls. Price was expected for a park. Then we made our way through the safari park. I have to say that the path around the safari park wasn't as great as the zoo. Sometimes I feel like we walked quite a bit before we saw any animals. Our favorite was the orangutans. We probably spent about 30-45 minutes here just watching them interact with each other. We watched one of the little ones do some break dancing, then he decided to steal the baby and the dad totally went after him. It was pretty entertaining.\n\nAfter we left the orangutans we kept walking the path, but a lot of times I felt like we were lost. This park is really big and there's a lot of walking involved.\n\nOverall it was ok. I think I actually enjoyed the San Diego Zoo more. I think if we hadn't done the extra encounter then I would feel like it would have been a bit of a bust.\n\nIf you've never been here then I recommend it, it's still fun.

Get to the park early and knock out the Africa tram first as the lines get more crowded as the day goes on. Also, its a big park with a lot of walking and you'll need all day to do it properly.\n\n2. Lemur exhibit - Go early as these guys sleep in the afternoons and you may not catch the little ones.\n\n3. Don't miss the tiger talks - it's a great learning experience for everyone and the tigers are just incredibly majestic.\n\n4. The Bird Show is very entertaining and informative.\n\n5. The Cheetah run - This is a sight to behold.\n\n6. Feed the Lorakeets. This is super cute as they come and sit down on your hand and lap up all the nectar mix (time independent but better to go early as the birds may get full).\n\nOverall, all the shows are well spaced out in terms of timings.

Not only did I get the chance to see the African and Asian animals up close in their habitat, but I also got to feed the giraffe and pet the rhino. This was definitely the highlight of my stay in SD. I was able to walk through most of the park and most of the animals were out and about. The animals I enjoyed the most were the Condors, Elephants, Lions, Lemurs, Gorilla, Wings of the World, Flamingos, and Hidden Jungle.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 3, 2017", 5.0, "A real adventure", "The tram ride is well worth the price just to see the African animals au natural. We enjoyed every corner of it. Be sure to get in early and get to the tram ride before long lines appear. Then see the rest of the park."], ["Reviewed August 2, 2017", 3.0, "A bit overpriced...", "The animals have their own spaces and it truly has a safari feel. We did the safari tour which was okay (we saw giraffes, rhinos, buffalos,...), but way too short and kind of disappointing. The Gorillas were pretty fun to look at and the Tiger spent the whole time just in front of the glass barrier offering us a great look at it. There was a loose deer near the elephants area who approached us and we got to take picture of it. But in my opinion, it is a bit overpriced.. You have to pay a minimum of 80-100$ if you want to spend a full day there (including parking and food).\n\nAlso, the shows there were okay, but not great.\nShow less"]]}}
