The zoo is situated on 2 hills with a deep valley in between so you do a lot of walking up and down hills. Almost all of the zoo is wheelchair accessible so the paths are very easily negotiated. Entrance fee includes a ride on the \"sightseeing\" bus as well as Skifari, an overhead tram. For an overall view of the zoo with some interesting facts thrown in, ride the bus and you can discover those areas you'd like to go on foot and see more. We thought we could see some of the animals from the Skifari but the vegetation is so dense you only wind up seeing the tops of trees - but that isn't a bad thing because it's beautiful up so high. As stated, they have a lot of trees so finding shade when it's hot is fairly easy. We were surprised to see a long line of people waiting to see an animal and found it is was for the panda exhibit. I don't feel that seeing any 1 particular animal at the zoo is worth an hour wait, but you may feel differently. The volunteers we spoke with were quite friendly and knowledgeable, pointing us in a couple of directions we might not have gone otherwise.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 2 days ago", 4.0, "Get there early!!", "I have visited twice and the experiences were very different.

The variety of species (especially African and Asian) is outstanding and it's easy to see why this is one of the premier zoos in the world. Bring comfy walking shoes and plan to make a day of it... there are several restaurants of relatively decent quality throughout the park. Parking is ample and free, and there are several bonus shows/lectures etc. that you can plan to attend throughout the day. There's a free bus tour for an overview of the zoo (and for those with difficulty walking), as well as a sky-tram that will take you from 1 end of the park to the other.

I was NOT disappointed.\nGet there when it opens at 9am. I arrived at 9:15 and people were pouring into the arrival gates. There were no lines whatsoever but you could tell it was going to be crowded. The 54 dollar admission may seem steep but this truly is a bucket list adventure. The park is HUGE. I took the bus tour at arrival which is a 30 minute slow ride around the park and the driver narrates where you are and ways to get around the zoo. It goes past all the popular exhibits and he/she will narrate a little about the animals. It was helpful to get your bearings before you start on your adventure.\nI have been to the national zoo and well as the Bronx Zoo- all very large with a lot of exhibits. The San Diego zoo allows you to get a lot closer to the animals than any other large zoo I have been to. Obviously you can touch any animals but you can see them really up close and many pictures came out so clear.\nThe Pandas were definitely the favorite exhibit and there were about 50 people on line to see them. The line moves quickly because they are in two exhibits and people are respectful of those waiting behind them in line. There is a koala exhibit that is spectacular. You will need to go to Australia to see more. They just built the exhibit and it was a delight to watch these creatures move about. The animals are always out and about even if it rains. The climate is perfect for them. A hippo baby was out with its mama as well as a newborn giraffe. The skyfari is included with admission and it is a cable car which takes you from one side of the park to the other. Helpful!\nIf you have little ones, strollers are permitted and you will need them. Adults get tired quickly here and I can only imagine kids.\nThere are animal showings and feedings throughout the day. The zoo map mentions this but it\u2019s kind of vague as to where and when. I lucked out to be in the right place and I caught an animal showing with a large African owl. It was literally 5 feet away from me on the keepers arm. It was so informative and the children thought it was amazing. I saw a feeding in the arctic fox exhibit.\nEvery zoo volunteer was so helpful and friendly as well. The grounds were a little confusing because there are lots of paths not marked. The zoo map is helpful but definitely make sure you ask for help before you walk a mile out of the way. :)\nI did not do any add on features. I called in advance to inquire about some of the add ons but for the cost I decided to pass. I observed a child inside one of the exhibits with a camera crew and I believe it was one of the special excursions you could do. She seemed thrilled!\nPark food is really reasonable but most families packed snacks. Souvenirs are also not out of control expensive. You will definitely want something to remind you of the trip. Rain ponchos are 4 dollars if you need one on the spot. I did!\nThe zoo also has a safari park which is about 30 mins north of San Diego. Definitely a return trip item.\nOverall, I spent almost the whole day at the zoo and I was very pleased!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 6 days ago", 5.0, "Fun day with the animals", "A well rum zoo with animals you won't see elsewhere.

There are also lots of volunteers around to help guide you and answer questions.\n\n*there is a lot of hilly terrain to walk up and down; so having the proper footwear is important. if walking isn't your idea of a good time, you can take a tour bus around the zoo or hop onto a Kangaroo bus, which has 4 stops throughout the zoo. another good way to travel is via the sky tram that gives you a great bird-eye view of the park.\n\n*the grounds are beautiful, and it's incredible to think of all the work that goes into maintaining this place. They offer behind-the-scenes tours too, so that you can really see the inner workings (you'll want to plan in advance to enjoy these).\n\n*There are lots of food choices from the typical carnival snacks, i.e. nachos, pretzels, popcorn to more sit-down options. We stopped at the Sabre-Tooth Grill, located near the elephants, and enjoyed some delicious food that is locally-sourced. We also brought in some of our own snacks, primarily so that our toddler wouldn't have a hunger melt-down.\n\n*parking is free and the lot fills up quickly. Be sure to take note of which aisle you parked in so that you can easily find your vehicle again.\n\n*there's so much to see that it can feel overhwhelming, but don't forget to just stop every once in a while and soak in the surroundings.

Plan on at least a half a day to see it all."], ["Reviewed 4 weeks ago", 5.0, "Bucket List Zoo", "I went Friday by myself to the zoo and I was really blown away. I have never seems such a place. The whole thing is an experience, even just walking between exhibits. It is very hard to use maps/ markings to navigate the zoo, it was easier and less frustrating to just wander. It took like 3-4 hours to walk around and see everything (by myself) I enjoyed the inclines and hiking of it. I would not have wanted to be pushing a stroller all day and I would worry about people with limited mobility or wheelchairs. I would worry about families with small children. It is a lot of incline walking. They have rentals for scooters but it did not seem like a safe place to navigate using a scooter (I saw two different elderly struggling with navigating the inclines in scooters). After I had covered the park on foot, I think took a ride on the double decker tour bus. It was a great way to end the day and rest my legs. This would be good for those with limited mobility. The 4 D movies are Kids cartoon shorts, so not worth adding to your ticket or unless traveling with children. I hoped maybe they would be zoo or wild animal related. The sky tram was not open on my visit, disappointing since that fee is included in ticket purchase. I enjoyed the gift selection. All and all a great visit for adults and families with older children (9-10 ish) who can navigate. Parking is easy. Zoo gets more crowded later in day, go early for smaller crowds.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 4 weeks ago", 5.0, "Best Zoo I have ever visited", "I have been to a number of zoos in my time but this was hands down the best, the kids loved it.. Be prepared to do a lot of walking though as this place is huge, stay hydrated too..Can\u2019t recommend enough!!"], ["Reviewed 4 weeks ago", 5.0, "Worth the $$$ and WOW", "The San Diego zoo is not cheap. Don't come under any illusions that you aren't going to shell out some big bucks. But the zoo is, and I've been to most notable zoos around the US, the most exceptionally beautiful and creatively laid out zoo I've ever seen. The new Africa Rocks exhibit is truly astonishing (sharks and penguins outside! A honey badger!). There are more aviaries and bird varieties than you can find anywhere. The reptiles not only have their own house (typical) they have their own outdoor trail (atypical!). The Hills make it a great walking zoo and give you a chance to see exhibits from different levels. But, little children and seniors could tucker out easily- rely more on the bus and trams if needed.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 4 weeks ago", 5.0, "Best zoo!", "I've heard a lot of people say great things about this zoo. This was the first stop on our southern California road trip. Getting to the zoo was fairly easy and parking was pretty easy as well. We mad it to the zoo before 10 am and there was still plenty of parking, we did go on a Thursday though, so not sure if the made a difference, but it was summer time. I believe the parking was free because I don't remember paying for parking. I'm glad I pre-bought our tickets online before we started our trip because the ticket booth lines were ridiculously long! Since we had our tickets we went straight to the entrance and started our zoo adventure. The zoo is pretty well laid out so you just keep walking the path and keep seeing the animals. I was very surprised at how close some of the animals were. It was the first time I had seen the giraffes up close, without having to do one of the feeding things. I think the elephants were my favorite! A lot of zoos don't even have elephants any more! The zoo just kept going and going. I think we ended up spending 7-8 hours at the zoo! And we didn't even see everything! I packed plenty of snacks and water for our day and we ate at one of the cafes in the zoo. The pricing wasn't too horrible. The food was fine, nothing fancy, but it was filling and kept us going. It was a pretty hot day and I probably got 2 or 3 of the frozen lemonades the later half of the day. It was a great cool down, since it was frozen it took us a while to eat it and we just kept walking with it! The petting zoo was fun and our 3 year old loved it! There's also a fun little kid play ground. Overall our family of 5, grandma, mom, dad, 11 year old son and 3 year old daughter loved this zoo! We had a great day! If you're visiting San Diego and thinking that you will do the zoo and visit Balboa Park and the surrounding areas in 1 day, you are wrong, I certainly was! The zoo will take up 1 day maybe even 2 if you have time. Plan accordingly.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 4 weeks ago", 5.0, "First visit", "Clean zoo. What ever you do, do not bike up there.

I have been twice when I have been in San Diego visiting family and still feel like I somehow missed some exhibits - although even if I knew I saw everything...I would still go back to SDZ every visit! I enjoyed the layout of the park, and everyone (locals) are always mentioning how the SDZ is constantly adding and changing exhibits. The staff is extremely kind and helpful too!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 4 weeks ago", 5.0, "Great zoo!", "We recently took our two children ages 13 and 15 to the San Diego Zoo. We spent a wonderful day and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. We especially loved seeing the polar bears, the Panda and a baby giraffe."]]}}
