Do not miss this museum if you like Warhol and Lichtenstein. We also took in the Edvard Munch exhibit which was also showing while we were there which inspired so many ideas for the new horror book I am writing. One minor criticism, there are a few names which seemed to be overlooked in the exhibit. Where were the Keith Haring, Basquiat, or Maplethorpe? Other than those exclusions I felt it was an amazing place.

I'm from the East Coast (Boston). Maybe this is how they define modern art on the West Coast, or maybe they're using the term \"modern art\" in a very general way. I'm thinking of the Museum of Modern Art (New York), Institute of Contemporary Art (Boston), or Mass MOCA. To me, Modern Art encompasses Abstract Expressionism, Surrealism, Cubism, Russian Constructivism, Dadaism, etc, roughly 1900 - 1950. What I saw here was mostly more recent than that. The only exceptions were the Isamu Naguchi exhibit (big Naguchi fan here), and one room of genuine \"modern\" art on the second floor. In my experience, Contemporary Art includes large installation pieces, video art, all created since about 1960, and that's mostly what I saw here.

My emphasis was on mainly on French Impressionism. When I was a junior in college I enrolled in an art history course - American contemporary art from the 1960s and onwards. One of the assignments of that class was writing a 10-page paper a single piece of painting at the old SF MOMA. I don't recall the name of the painter however I remember the name of the painting \"White\". That painting had different variations of white with visible brushstrokes. Just imaging writing a 10-page paper on this painting? Yeah it was that difficult especially since I'm not a fan of contemporary art. There was something intriguing about SF MOMA when I was at college. However when I went to the old SF MOMA I felt the layout of museum was dated and unorganized as some of the galleries didn't highlight the exhibition or artwork. Maybe that was why I did like contemporary art. The last time I went to the SF MOMA before it was renovated was in 2007 to see the exhibition \"Pablo Picasso in American Art\". This was best modern art exhibition I have ever seen because it not only showed Picasso's art but also other American artists that he had influence on.\n\nWhen the SF MOMA opened after its renovation I wanted to go here especially since the museum is about less than a 10-minute walk from my work. I admit when it comes to visiting a museum it is due to the exhibition. During the Memorial Day Weekend there were two exhibitions that were on the day after Memorial Day - \"Monet: The Early Years\" at the Legion of Honor and \"Matisse/ Diebenkorn\" at the SF MOMA. Claude Monet is my favorite painter of all time. I do believe in order expand my repertoire of art appreciation I needed to go to the SF MOMA for that exhibition. Before I decided to go I did some research. I heard about Henri Matisse but not Richard Diebenkorn. I discovered he graduated from Stanford in 1949. That is the reason why I decided to go to the exhibition because as a novice art historian who graduated from Cal I wanted to see works from an artist who graduated from Stanford. I was very glad that I decided to go to the SF MOMA that weekend. From looking at the Diekenborn's paintings you progressions from throughout the works. Even though he graduated from Stanford you see his paintings from his Berkeley series how he interprets the layout of the city. What I liked about this exhibition is you see a painting from Matisse side by side of a painting from Diebenkorn. Even though the paintings are not exact you see how Diebenkorn referred to Matisse when it came to shades of color. The similarities of the paintings would involve the same subject matter however each artist interpreted differently the subject matter such as Henri Matisse's \"Woman with a Hat\", a painting of Matisse's wife, or Diebenkorn's painting of his wife. Going to the SF MOMA for this exhibition challenged me and I was glad for it.\n\nWorking in the Financial District in SF I would pass by the Academy of Art and sometimes noticed some of the artworks. I felt these students would try to become like Picasso with his cubist style. Well to understand how Picasso became Picasso you have to understand what was his influences. If artists who aspire to become Picasso then have to study Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, who Picasso studied a lot from to incorporate his works. For aspiring artists the SF MOMA is a great access as it is downtown SF and is close to Bart. In the future if there are other exhibitions like \"Pablo Picasso in American Art\" or \"Matisse/ Diebenkorn\" I say it is a prerequisite for aspiring artists who want to progress because history is influential in art.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 9, 2017", 5.0, "Wonderful way to spend half a day if you're in the city", "Time flies when you're walking around this museum.

Even if you don't need anything there are lots of fun gifts for family and friends who didn't get a chance to go.\n\nArt makes us beautiful inside.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 6, 2017", 4.0, "EDVARD MUNCHEN EXHIBIT A MUST!!", "We recently visited the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art for the first time since the reopening and renovation. We bought our tickets in advance online. I'd recommend that if you are not already a member. That way, you can just go in and avoid the ticket lines. We went on a Saturday so it was quite busy. You may HAVE to buy tickets in advance to lock in an arrival/check in time. It seems as thought that's a requirement nowadays.\n\nWe went there specifically to see the Edvard Munchen exhibit. We highly recommend this visit and you will have to pay separately. It's worth it. Many of his famous paintings are available for viewing, including \"Despair\" and \"Despair 2\". The only odd disappointment is that \"Scream\" was not part of this exhibit.\n\nBut wait, there's more to the museum of course than just the special exhibits. As all great museums, they have continuing and permanent collections of great artists like Alexander Calder, Wayne Thiebaud, and Ellsworth Kelly, Andy Warhol, and special local artists/exhibits like Mike Mandel. There is also a 7th floor exhibit with some unique creations by various artists (very interesting). Check out the suspended upside drum playing and the floating water bowl chimes.\n\nUnfortunately, the only issue was with the audio devices. We've learned over time and visiting other museums that these devices are not seamless in operation. Again, one of our audio players would malfunction and had to be reset. Of course, we would have to go back to the main exhibit entrance to reset. Also, the devices will run low battery. This seems to be an ongoing problem. The audio devices really do add to the education and understanding of the artists and pieces.\n\nWhen you go please plan on taking your time and plan on enjoying a full day or afternoon. It's worth it.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 5, 2017", 5.0, "SFMOMA (So far my only museum article!) - the perfect place to take your Munchkins!", "O.K. Call me a Philistine if you will. I live only forty-five minutes from San Francisco, but I can't remember the last time that I made the effort to get from Pleasanton into the city twice in the same week. That changed for the first time in years recently when I was drawn from my East Bay refuge by the Edward Munch exhibit currently showing at SFMOMA. I must admit that part of the attraction was to experience the recently renovated building, but it was the opportunity to view the Munch canvasses that sealed the deal! The SFMOMA is an amazing, bright and airy building in which to display works of art, but the advances in art appreciation that it provides are just as impressive. By accessing their free SFMOMA app on my iPhone, I was able to listen to commentary on a selection of the Munch canvasses, which was vastly superior to simply reading the tiny panels hung on the wall near to each work. I enjoyed myself so much in the Munch exhibit that I continued my exploration of the museum's other floors, discovering to my immense delight an exhibition on Andy Warhol and the Pop Artist movement and many more of my favorites such as, Matisse, Magritte, Dali and more. I took a break for lunch and enjoyed a delicious cheese and charcuterie platter with a glass of Cote de Rhone in the museum restaurant. There is also a coffee shop for those in need of a quick caffeine fix and a pastry. As I wandered through the various floors of the museum, I saw so many parents with their kids pointing out facts about the artist's life and painting style. It occurred to me that a museum like SFMOMA is a pretty cool place to take the kids during summer vacation. They are never too young to develop an appreciation of art and SFMOMA is a perfect museum to start the process.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 5, 2017", 5.0, "Loved it!!!

The second floor has a great, somewhat limited Impressionist and Cubist section. Upper floors have modern art and photography with some rather unique structures and paintings. There are four floors in total with plenty of space for viewing. There did not appear to be any prohibitions on photography. There is a cafe in the middle and a peaceful outdoor area with sculptures including several by Calder. Definitely worth a visit to this museum. Entry cost was $25 for adults (discount for those 65 years and older) plus $6 for the special Munch exhibit.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 4, 2017", 5.0, "Edward Munsch Exhibit", "The numerous Edward Munsch paintings on display made this excursion worth every penny.

The art has plenty of space which really gives you the opportunity to enjoy it without being overwelmed. I especially liked the photography section of the museum. There is also a big focus on american artists which was very interesting from a european point of view.\n\nWhen I visited a surprisingly large number of rooms were closed off due to setting up new exhibitions, so it felt like half the museum was not accesible. Also there were a lot of noise from the cafe in the middle of the museum and from the entrence which you could hear all over. It was sometimes a bit disturbing.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 3, 2017", 4.0, "Loved New Addition", "Went to see the Munch Exhibit currently at MOMA.

Highlight for me was seeing some works by Andy Warhol."], ["Reviewed August 1, 2017", 5.0, "First Time Since New Addition", "If you are a fan of Modern Art this is one of the finest in the world. The extensive renovation and additional space has transformed a wonderful space into one that can better showcase their permanent collection (now enhanced by their partnership with the Fisher family collection) and still have adequate space for special exhibitions (presently a wonderful presentation of about 50 of Edvard Munch paintings). The docents are exceptional and they are trying out a new method using headsets so that the distractions of others in the museum don't disrupt the docent leading the discussion. many of the docents like to get the group involved making for an interactive as well as educational time. Especially with modern art, everyone has their own opinion and that variety enhances the experience. The cafe is pretty much the same (didn't go this time) and the outdoor sculpture garden (a magical place) was being renovated. The only downside to the new facility was the signage especially between the new upper floors (six and seven), the bridge, and the new areas. Without the paper \"map\" one could end up wasting time going back and forth.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 28, 2017", 5.0, "excellent museum!", "I live in new york and have traveled as well; always going to museums in each city. the SFMOMA was simply the best museum of modern art I have been to."]]}}
