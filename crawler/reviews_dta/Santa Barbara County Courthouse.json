So most tourists might say \"that's boring, let's skip that\". But the Santa Barbara Courthouse is much more than that. In many ways it is the heart of the city. During the Fiesta, and at other times of the year as well, the Sunken Garden (a large lawn on the inside of the \"L\" formed by the Court building) serves as an outdoor theater. This is where people sit while an elevated stage is erected next to the outside stairway. Various organizations hold award ceremonies and other such events here. The building is probably the best example of the Spanish Mission style that was invented in and for Santa Barbara and is not found anywhere else, since this style is a merging of several different architectural styles. The building is beautiful inside and out. Be sure to stop at the second floor mural courtroom that depicts the history of this area. It is usually open and sign near the elevator will indicate how to get there. This room also serves occasionally for evening concerts. Finally, be sure to take the elevator to the top floor and then take stairs one more floor up to the observation deck, the only such place in Santa Barbara. If you want to go inside the building, you will have to come during regular business hours. However, the building is also really beautiful at night, when it is lit up. But then you can just look, you cannot explore the inside or go to the observation deck. For couples looking for a place to get married, the Courthouse has I think 2 or 3 different options, and you could hardly find a prettier setting.

You can actually watch cases (though I went on a holiday weekend so no court was in session). I was still able to go into a courtroom and see the walls covered with big murals. It was interesting to see since my only views of courtrooms has been on judge Judy, the people's court, and making a murderer.\n\nYou can catch an elevator or walk up the stairs to the top of the court tower and see 360 degree views of the city. Great to see and get some panorama shots of the city for your social networking memories (or albums for the older gens).\n\nThere are paintings in the halls and some other memorabilia, but they didn't quite grab my attention so I can't even remember what they were of.\n\nPROS:\n1) Free!!\n2) It will be better than you expect!\n3) Great views and photo op\n\nCONS:\n1) can't think of any as long as you go in knowing what your going there for.

The tiled walls and mosaics were breathtaking. We made our way to the very steep stairs up to the observation deck and we could not believe our eyes. There were 360 degree views. We spent about 20 minutes up there taking pictures and soaking up the views. It was foggy over the beach that day so we could not see the water, but the sun was high and the city looks amazing.
