This is not like any Wharf you've been to. First off, you can drive right onto the Wharf and there's plenty of parking. You pay a very reasonable parking fee on the way out so no worries about overstaying a parking meter and getting a ticket.\nThere are lots of restaurants featuring local catch, souvenir stores, fishing expeditions, and fishing. As you stroll the Wharf, you will likely hear the melodic howls of the sea lions that love to hang out on the structural members under the Wharf. There are lots of places from which you can watch them lazing around or climbing over each other.\nOn one side of the Wharf is the World famous surfing area, Steamer Lane, On the other side is the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, the oldest amusement park West of the Mississippi. I believe it was voted the best beachside amusement park in America at least once. It is very well managed. The Boardwalk\u2019s original Ruth & Sohn band organ has played alongside the Looff Carousel since 1911. In addition to the original Ruth organ, a rare Wurlitzer 165 band organ from the former Playland-at-the Beach amusement park in San Francisco now shares playing time with the Ruth. There is also indoor miniature golf and a large game arcade, all in an iconic building right on the beach.\nIf you can, sit down to dinner at one of the restaurants just before sunset. You'll be at eye level with dozens of birds cruising by the windows and the sunsets are beautiful.\nIf that's not enough for one spot, Santa Cruz just added the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Exploration Center.\nLastly, Roaring Camp Railroad, another must do in Santa Cruz, has a tourist train that runs from their replica Old West Village in Felton down to the Boardwalk. In fact, you can take an early train down from Felton and spend the day at the Beach and Wharf, then take a later train back up to Felton.
