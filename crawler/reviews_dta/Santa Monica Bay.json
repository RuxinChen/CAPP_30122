You can even enjoy the view and the Bay by walking along Ocean Avenue which looks down on the Pacific Coast Highway the beach area.\n\nMost special of all is the sunset. It is spectacular and special. My sons used to crawl along the beach while my wife and I drank a margarita or cold beer.

Well, the pier is fun, but that's a review for another day. This is about the bay itself, the long crescent that runs down from Malibu to Palos Verdes, that contains a host of sea life, sailboats, fishing boats, usually an oil tanker or two, with an astonishing amount of Marine traffic on its western edge.\n\nThere are some key geographic markers for the landlubbers and sailers alike. For me, it starts at the north with the Malibu pier. Some brave souls will anchor nearby, as the depth is relatively shallow and take a kayak in, but there's no official landing: you'll have to surf in and beach the kayak. Then there's the Santa Monica Pier, (the address above). That has a lot of history, and still has the old-time 20's vibe to it. If you're out to sea, you'll be sure to notice the seals and sea lions that hang out on the buoy near the pier, and watch out for the submerged shoals north of the pier. It's a good marker--we like to sail up just past the pier, and tack back down toward the Marina. If the wind is right, we'll set the spinnaker just to put on a show for the kids on the pier.\n\nAlong this stretch as well, you'll see parasailers (especially in summer) being towed by speedboats along the beach, which is also a pretty sight. Some other marine life to look out for include Pacific sunfish basking near the surface, and not infrequently a curious dolphin or three. And if you're fishing, you'll probably meet a seal trying to steal your catch.\n\nFurther south, there's the Venice pier, and the Marina Del Rey harbor entrance, marked by a giant American flag. There's a distinct aroma here, as a large colony of sea lions can be found hanging out on the breakwater year round. Further south, you'll almost certainly pass an oil tanker riding at anchor near the El Segundo refinery pipeline -- if you're on a keel boat at low tide, be careful of the snags! You'll pass under the LAX flight path on your way to King Harbor, which is a fun stop. Pro tip: you can reserve a mooring at basin 3 for 24 bucks a night should you need to stop on your way up or down the coast.\n\nSouthern tip ends with Malaga Cove, named after one of my favorite cities in Spain. The Palos Verdes cliffs rise up, covered with some of the most expensive real estate in the Los Angeles area.\n\nYou can get charters and daytrips for sightseeing, fishing and whalewatching on the Bay from Marina Del Rey and King Harbor. It's the fastest way to get out of the city, and deep into nature within at least three hundred miles. Or you can just rent a Sabot or Lazer, or paddleboard and just tool around the marina.

Spanish explorer, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo commanded the first European expedition to the west coast of the America. He dropped anchor in Santa Monica in 1542, a mere fifty years after Columbus sailed the ocean blue to the new world in 1492. There was no Panama canal then so he had to navigate the treacherous water around the south tip of South America.\n\nFast forward to modern times. One might wonder why Los Angeles was not first settled with Santa Monica as the epicenter. The rich and famous discovered it, including William Randolph Hurst who built his mistress Marion Davies a palatial mansion right on the beach. The mansion is long gong but the olympic sized pool remains open to the public along with her guest house -- which by today's standards could be considered a modest mansion -- also open to the public.\n\nThe best place to appreciate the panoramic vista of the bay is along Pacific Palisades Park. Lined by palm trees, it is in my opinion the most picturesque spot in Santa Monica if not all of Los Angeles. It begins at Pico Blvd. and winds north all the way up to San Vicente Blvd. From there you can view from left to right, Palos Verdes peninsula, Catalina Island, the iconic Santa Monica Pier (with roller coaster and ferris wheel at the end) and Malibu.\n\nDon't miss the 3rd Street Promenade mall that begins at the famous Miramar Hotel (every movie star from the golden age and luminaries from all over the world have stayed there -- and where I honeymooned). Walk south to Santa Monica Place outdoor mall.\n\nThere are many great restaurants that adorn Ocean Avenue, with open window views of Palisades Park and the bay. If you are lucky, you may see a pod of Killer Whales that call the bay their home.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 13, 2017", 3.0, "It is a nice place to people watch and look at the ocean from a world famous pier.", "It's free to walk to and enter if you are staying in Santa Monica. I'd park at the Third Street Promenade parking (free), earlier in the day the better, and walk down the driveway towards the Pier. It's a nice pier with attractions and rides for the kids. On a clear day you can see as far north as Pt. Dume and and far south as the Santa Catalina Islands. As the day progresses though, it becomes slightly sketchy as a certain element starts to show up. Nothing to be alarmed about, but definitely more adult at that point.
