The Ferris wheel on the Santa Monica Pier can be seen in numerous tv shows & movies and is part of a great little amusement park that is ON the Pier.\n\nYou can park directly on the pier; just drive down the big hill and follow the signs. You could also park in one of the public lots up the street, but it's a pretty steep walk back up (especially if you're pushing a stroller or have tired, small children with you). Touristy shops line the pier and there's a Bubba Gump restaurant at the base of the pier. The view of the Pacific is incredible.\n\nMy absolute favorite thing on the Santa Monica Pier is a once in a lifetime experience - The Trapeze School of New York (Los Angeles location) has a spot where you can take flying trapeze lessons.

Bring the Whole Family!", "The Santa Monica pier was a super cool place for the whole family, and you must give the better portion of your day to being there. It's a pretty long walk across the bridge especially if there are little kids with you and they may get tired out pretty fast. Once you are actually at the pier, there is a lot going on. If you see some people with a spinner offering you 2 free nights of vacation, it's most likely a scam. It was fun to play, however. There was also a small basketball court which part of the all-star NBA weekend took place, which was cool to see. The mini amusement park was really awesome, and a lot of the carnival game booths on the side were really fun, and the prizes all large and possible to win. There were a many rides, and the coolest was by far the roller coaster, which is very easy but goes around twice. There is also a boat swing, frogger, and more, which gives people of all ages a ton to do. Each ride varied from around $5-10, yet unlimited rides for the whole day was only $18, so that would be super fun to do if you have the whole day. The ticket booth in the front has a huge line, but if you sneak your way to the back entrance, there is a booth with almost no one in line (don't tell!). The beach is worth walking around in, but personally the amusement park was the best part. Since everything is nearby, people can choose what they would like to do and meet up right after, making it the ideal situation (much like Coney Island in NYC).

It has been featured in countless films, television shows, music videos and even video games (Grand Theft Auto V immediately comes to mind). It has been designated a historic landmark since 1976 and has a rich, storied history since its opening. (Seriously, read a little bit about it and discover some of its more darker past during Prohibition and the WWII era. It's fascinating!)\n\nIt's also REALLY cool to visit. At just over \u00bc of a mile long, the pier offers lots of entertaining options to keep you busy for a few hours. Most noticeable/famous on the pier is the Pacific Park seaside amusement park (with its legendary Pacific Wheel Ferris wheel and West Coaster junior roller coaster), along with 10 other rides. Additional options include the original Hippodrome building (with its original indoor carousel) from the 1920s, a trapeze school(!!), the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium, plus numerous shops, restaurants, bars/pubs, entertainers, and other attractions. At the far western end of the pier, you will see numerous anglers fishing, as well as find restrooms and a somewhat upscale restaurant for memorable dining. The pier is fun during the day, but it's at night when it REALLY comes alive, with all the lights, music, cool ocean breeze and entertainment options that give it a magical quality. You never know what you're going to see there, from Chinese Acrobats, to musicians playing exotic and foreign instruments many Americans aren't accustomed to seeing, to fortune tellers, magicians, and other acts. It really is a neat place to visit. The Santa Monica Police Department has a station on the pier, so police presence is regular. I've never felt unsafe while visiting.\n\nIt's busy though. Even at night, the pier can be so packed with people that walking gets difficult. I've seen lines for the rides at Pacific Park an hour long at 11pm before. Finding places to eat, places to grab a drink, and a place to park your car can be a real challenge. I recommend avoiding the Santa Monica Beach/Pier and Pacific Park on the weekends in the summer because it just gets to be too busy to truly enjoy yourself.\n\nDespite its popularity and overcrowding issues, if you find yourself in LA with time to kill and you haven't been to the Santa Monica Pier, you HAVE to go. It's one of those life experiences that you will be glad to cross off your bucket list (even if you never intend to return again)!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 4 weeks ago", 5.0, "Crowded but amazing", "Wished I could've stayed longer.

But I never made it to see the Santa Monica Pier until near the end of our last visit. The occaison was prompted by a visit to see my niece who had recently relocated from Brentwood to Santa Monica. We planned to meet for dinner after she got out of work. I went a little early so I could see the Pier. Found a parking spot a few blocks from the Pier and got to it just after sunset. The Pier was crowded with people and the lights had just come on. The Ferris Wheel and roller coaster were carrying lots of people. Lots of street musicians with skills that ranged from ear-hurting to pretty damn good. Lots of shops with stuff I think only tourists would buy. The restaurants weren't that interesting in that they were often-seen chain reataurants that charge higher prices because they are on the Pier. Even so, most of them were full of people. At the end of the Pier, there is a second floor observation deck and I'm sure the sunset views are absolutely stunning. Wouldn't recommend that visitors go out of their way and through heavy traffic to come here though. Unlike the Piers in Huntington Beach and Seal Beach, there isn't much room for people to fish.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 7, 2018", 4.0, "About what you would expect.", "Great place to visit just from an historic perspective.
