It's a lovely beach: large and spacious with great views up and down the coast and buildings that don't rise above several stories high (thanks to the oppressive California Coastal Commission). The breeze from the Santa Ana Winds always feels good and there are plenty of lifeguards on duty with a regular police presence, so safety isn't an issue. The beach is pretty clean from what I've seen on the days I've visited, there are free outdoor showers for washing off salt/sand (but no bathhouses that I've seen), and there's plenty of places to eat/use the restrooms at the Santa Monica Pier. It's a great place to kill an afternoon!\n\nMy biggest gripe, however, is how busy the Santa Monica Beach can get. Seeing as how it IS such an iconic beach, you will find it far more busy and crowded than other beaches, including neighboring beaches located just down the coast a little way. On a typical day, it's busy but not overly packed, but if you go on a peak day, you can find yourself having to pack in uncomfortably close to other beach-goers...or giving up because there's just no place to stake out for your group for the day. Keep that in mind if you're thinking about going on a Saturday in July! You may find yourself having better luck at Venice, Leo Carrillo, El Matador, Malibu or Manhattan Beaches (as just a few examples) instead. In addition, parking can be difficult to find on busier days too. There are city run beach/pier parking lots, but they fill up quickly. In the 4 times I've been there, I've never used the city lots for parking; I've always had to park in one of the seaside hotel underground parking garages (for $20+) because the city lots were full and traffic was at absolute gridlock.\n\nIf you've never been there, you need to go. I chuckle each time I visit, because Santa Monica Beach is the beach that was modeled for the video game \"Grand Theft Auto V,\" and everything--including the Santa Monica Pier, surrounding buildings and even the lifeguard shacks--is modeled down to the most minute detail that you can see in real life when you visit the Santa Monica Beach.

Being from Australia and spoilt when it comes to beautiful beaches, the actual beach/ocean is nothing special and certainly not worth the time. The real attraction of this place is all of the activity going on around it. Ranging from all of the muscle-beach type workout areas, to the locals getting together and providing street performances/music/dancing etc. The real contrast to Australia was that the place was fairly quiet and boring during the morning and then came to life in the afternoon.\n\nThe reason for visiting is to experience the culture, nothing like what we have back home. We stayed near the Santa Monica Pier, which is another reason to come here.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 12, 2017", 3.0, "Go with an open mind", "Santa Monica beach is a nice beach but not one of the best places to visit, if your short on time and can visit 2 beaches come here because of the pier, it is fun and close to the beach.

The other beaches we went to were more Sandy in the water than this one, which was good. The waves were perfect, not to strong for the smaller niece, and okay to go out further a little more. We went from 330-645 and it was nice, a little chilly but the sun warmed you up. The water was pretty cold at first. When we were leaving the beach, I did step on a piece of glass that was buried in the sand, it didn't break the skin but it could have been a lot worse if it did, or if my nieces would have stepped on it.

Pure ecstasy!", "The first time when I visited the US, one of my friends back home suggested to pay a visit to Santa Monica, when I go to LA. I had the experience of unclean beaches (empty disposable water bottles, food packets, other plastic waste) in the past back home and hence I was not very much interested. Once, I checked into the hotel, the room had this brochures with all tourist spots nearby and this was one of them\n\nI decided to give it a try. I'm glad that I had taken the best decision. Santa Monica is a delight. And being a solo indian girl, I realized that it is very safe too! Sunrise at Santa Monica is beyond words. A must see, for everyone who visit California. You could even pedal a cycle. A very clean white sandy beach with an extremely beautiful sea! You could get food, water and everything else. Public transport is available to reach.\nShow less"]]}}
