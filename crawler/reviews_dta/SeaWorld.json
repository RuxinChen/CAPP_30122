There's a lot of ground to cover. Be sure and ride the tower to get a wonderful view of the park and surrounding area. Unbelievably large parking area! I loved watching the very large flock of flamingos \"performing\" their daily march. Lovely to watch! The dolphin show was quite entertaining and enjoyable. I was a little saddened by the killer whales - the pools just don't look large enough to give such a majestic creature the room they deserve and the bent dorsal fin on one whale is something I've NEVER seen in the wild (I live in Washington state and have watched them in Puget Sound) even though the park would have you believe it just \"happens\" to killer whales.

A wonderful experience for kids to be exposed to the wonders of the ocean and learn about all the creatures that live under the sea. SeaWorld is helping to educate and expose children to our oceans which hopefully it is a platform to begin teaching them to respect mother earth (maybe adults can learn too). I can't forget that they have added some really great rides for each height level.

They have added rides and experiences so you can have fun in any corner of the park. There are so many animal encounter opportunities that you will want to come back over and over again. Our favorites have been the beluga whale and penguin encounters. Most months have a new theme, so there is a good variety throughout the year. While our favorite is the Food and Wine Festival during March and April, we hit as many of the themes as we can because it's a great way to get exercise, see some of the world's most amazing animals, and enjoy iconic vistas of San Diego.

You'll need an entire day to see everything (as well as the physical fitness and willingness to walk several miles across the sprawling park), but the target audience of the attraction seems to be 4-to-13 year-old children. This was reflected in the cheesiness of the dolphin and sea lion shows. The orca show was more informative, but the speeches of the presenters contained an inordinate amount of filler words and phrases, which distracted from their talking points.\n\nAs for the rides, the Manta was the only true thrill ride that was open when I visited (which was disappointing-I would have liked more excitement), and the Wild Arctic ride was completely pathetic. It is laughable that a ride that poor exists at a major theme park-look it up. The gondola and the Skytower did provide good views of the area, but I would not recommend either for those who fear heights.

It's not pure animal entertainment like it used to be.\n- They've made big strides in making the park more ethical after the controversy following Blackfish. It's a complicated issue, but overall SeaWorld seems to be doing pretty well now. They're AZA approved, and they agreed to stop breeding orcas (though they're keeping their existing orcas until they die naturally, since they can't survive in the wild).\n\nThe bad:\n- They will milk you for every cent in your pocket after you're in the park. E.g. I paid $185 to interact with their beluga whales, which was amazing and wonderful, until at the end of the experience I learned it would cost me $90 to get digital copies of the photos they took (which only come on a CD, as if anyone still has a CD drive...). Guys, just charge everyone $20 more from the start and give everyone free photos (rather than just the handful of people who shell out $90)--you'll earn just as much and nobody will leave feeling gypped. I'd also rather pay a modestly higher entry fee in exchange for having affordable concessions in the park. Abusing a captive audience isn't going to leave people happy with their experience.\n- A few of their animal enclosures still feel degrading to the animals, even if they aren't necessarily harmful to them. E.g. the sea lion enclosure allows people to feed sea lions from above with minimal supervision, and they're basically just begging and barking for food from everyone all day.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 6 days ago", 5.0, "Wonderful", "We all had a wonderful time.

It\u2019s gotten expensive over the years, but they\u2019ve wonderfully continued to support the local military community by offering free tickets every year. The shows have changed where as now they offer more of a glimpse into what trainers go through to rehab and train animals instead of just putting on a show. They have become more educational, which for me, helps answers questions I\u2019ve always had about what marine biologists do. It\u2019s always exciting to see the dolphins jump out of the water and they look happy and healthy. I do wish they had a bigger pool because what we see looks extremely small compared to the freedom they would have in the ocean. Obviously, the ones born at Sea World, would never make it in the wild, so it\u2019s safer for them to be at the park.

After getting the same answer over and over again I began asking for my money back. She never said she would give me my money back and insisted that I email the other company for my photos. That took 2 weeks and I got nowhere so I emailed Denise back stating I wanted my money back and she never responded. I then finally got to VIEW my photos after constant emails but I still think for the aggravation something more still could have been done. So I emailed Denise about my money back and she responded that she contacted the other company and as I can view my photos that if their was anything else I needed to let her know. I am still upset because at that point I was still telling her I wanted my money back or a refund and no email back. I even asked Denise for the name of her supervisor and still no email. I tried calling the customer service number for SeaWorld Orlando and they kept directing my call to email Denise. This is ridiculous. I am reporting it to my credit card company as nobody will respond to my emails.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 2 weeks ago", 5.0, "Wonderful Visit", "We visited Seaworld San Diego on a Sunday in February, and there were a lot of people but it wasn't crowded.

As I states I have been there several times sometimes there are a large amount of animals in the different tanks and other times there maybe only one or two. I do believe that most of the exhibits have areas where the animals can go hide from the public.

Their holiday experience was so much fun with even real Reindeer (they come from a rescue place in Los Angeles) with a trainer to answer so many questions. If you aren't there during the holidays you won't be able to see their Nativity show... it was just a WOW nothing I've seen before and went twice, even my husband loved it and that says alot. If you miss it don't be worried. Their new Orca Encounter is just as exciting as before and really gives you the educational background of Orcas. Everywhere you go the people are friendly, the rides are fun and again there are staff on hand to answer questions on the Beluga Whales, Orcas, dolphins, Turtles... you name it. So you can take this as far as you want to be educational to learn about the animals as well as what SeaWorld does for them (I've seen first hand living near the ocean with how they help with the Seals) or just have fun with the shows and rides. I've seen bad reviews on the food, but I've never had a horrible meal -- I've done Dine with Shamu which is just great, had no idea as to what expect and didn't want to leave, most of the times go to Shipwreck where the food is good and big portions.

Several of the rides are in fact right on the bay. Like all the other parks in the chain, Sea World is immaculately clean and beautifully themed. There aren't a ton of thrill rides like at Disney, Knott's, or Universal, but the shows and aquarium exhibits more than make up for it. We bought the quick queue passes but didn't really need them except on the rapids ride. After a few days at Disney, the slower pace at Sea World feels like a vacation from vacation.\n\nThere are plenty of rides for small children and an adorable Sesame Street area. Older kids and adults will love the marine aquarium exhibits. As I mentioned there are few thrill rides but the quality more than makes up for a lack of quantity (plus they are adding one more coaster in 2018). A ride on Manta alone is worth admission. There are two very good water rides as well, a rapids ride and the incredible Journey to Atlantis which mixes a log flume ride with an indoor roller coaster.\n\nThere are a lot of cute shops, though the merchandise is pretty generic across all Sea World parks, nothing to really distinguish San Diego from San Antonio from Orlando. We didn't do any shows this time as all of the theaters are outdoors with very limited protection from the sun, something unique to this park.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed December 30, 2017", 5.0, "Super fun- kids loved it!", "Kids had a blast.
