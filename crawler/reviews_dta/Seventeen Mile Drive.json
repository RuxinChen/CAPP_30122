You can bike (most of it), walk it, drive it, be driven in it, you can breeze through or take a whole day. It is easily marked and followed (part of the fee) and even provides an audio tour (part of the fee) and the roads and markers are well maintained (part of the fee-get the picture?) and the facilities were well maintained. The drive does offer a lot of Ooos and Ahhs even if you are not impressed with the golf course with people who pay one of my mortgage payments to shoot a round. The pics here are a good representation of what you get to see. Lastly, it really is iconic California and preserved to keep it that way.\nCons-OK\u2026the fee. Yeah, it costs to get in but if you had thousands of tourists wearing down your streets you may want to share the load as well. Think of it like Jurassic Park, but instead of dinosaurs you have rich folk. We did not have any traffic concerns but saw all the stops for tour buses and such so I suppose it can get busy. It is pretty and all but most of it is \u201cstop and look\u201d kind of things.

Driving through some golf courses and catching some ocean views from not too special view points, the drive was a disappointment after the free highways and roads we had been on all day. The staff at the entry gate was unhelpful, the drive crowded, there were too few parking spaces and restrooms were nowhere to be found except in very few locations with misleading sign posts. While the lone cypress and the ghosttree were nice to see, this was definitely not worth it.

Some of the stops along the way were not worth stopping but Bird Rock was amazing. Not only is it covered in birds, but the harbour seals climbing the rocks and jumping in the water below the rock are so fun to watch. You can hear them barking and having a great time! We got great photos with our zoom lenses. We also enjoyed the stop at the Lone Cypress - such a pretty lookout. The Lodge at Pebble Beach is worth a stop as well, given the iconic golf course is located here, however we found the people quite snobby. I asked where the beach was and the woman I asked looked down her nose at me and said \"There really isn't a beach but if you are looking for the water and the 18th hole, it is down that way.\" I just wanted to see the view of the water since I figured it must be pretty. The 18th hole looked so beautiful with the water as the backdrop so I was glad we walked down to see it. The gift shops sold outrageously priced golf shirts and most of them were striped. My husband wanted to buy a shirt. There were a few more reasonably priced ones but we didn't like all the stripes and there were none in his size in solid colours. I don't think I would have paid the price to eat there but many people were enjoying a meal at the Lodge, out on the patio. The highlight was definitely Bird Rock on the 17 mile drive!

It costs you about $10 to make the drive, but it's worth it! You get a map and can plan where to stop. It was pretty crowded Saturday, so maybe a week day is better. But the weather was good and the views were fabulous! Parking was a challenge due to the size of the crowds, but I only stop0ped where I really wanted to and avoided a bit of the rush.
