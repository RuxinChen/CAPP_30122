I came primarily for the roller coasters so this review will be primarily based off of that. I would say their selection of coasters was just ok. Joker and Superman Ultimate Flight were fun but nothing mind blowing. Medusa and V2 were also good. Boomerang and Kong however were just awful experiences. Every coaster had one train operations besides Medusa and despite low crowd levels lines were still longer than they should of been especially for Joker and Superman.The park overall looks nice but is littered with ads. The themes are very minimal on the rides, in the Joker line they were playing the Superman theme which doesn't make any sense at all. The animals were a unique touch to a six flags park but some of the exhibits were kind of dirty. The Shark exhibit was littered with fly's by its entrance as well. Food options wern't very good. Everything was overpriced but they had a ok variety. Overall if you need a day to kill and your in the bay area I would reccomend it but if you had to choose between this park and California's Great America I would recommend you go to Great America instead.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 1 week ago", 3.0, "Okay after the long wait of confusion", "We were planning a great day at the park with the kids, bought tickets online at the hotel we were staying at as a perk price. The hotel front desk screwed up and got us tickets for two weeks away. We sat at the ticket booth for nearly 2 hours for the supervisor to figure out how to fix our tickets. They ended up refusing our tickets and then charging us for daily tickets, which did not reflect the discount we should of got. So they cancelled those tickets and started over, in all charging our card 4 times. Once it was all done, we were finally able to enjoy the park, but the rudeness of the staff to begin with just really made it hard to enjoy our trip. We'll try again another time, hopefully without the confusion.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 2 weeks ago", 3.0, "Family Fun", "Discovery Kingdom; is a nice place to visit, it has good attractions and offers an array of things to do.

The first time I spent only a few hours and managed to get on 3 roller coasters - Medusa, Kong, and Superman: Ultimate Flight. The second time I spent the entire day so I was able to ride every roller coaster minus 2 that I chose not to ride. Here are some brief reviews of the coasters:\n\nMedusa: Very fun floorless coaster that can be a little rattly but it's not an issue. Has a massive vertical loop and a few fairly intense elements.\n\nKong: A terrible inverted roller coaster. DO NOT RIDE. Gave me a headache and a several bruises. This ride will beat you up. Don't put yourself in pain.\n\nSuperman: Ultimate Flight: A super fun launch coaster. Highly recommended. Very intense and delivers great hangtime and airtime. Didn't have to wait at all.\n\nThe Joker: Their newest coaster. The Joker is a very fun roller coaster with insane airtime. I recommend that you ride later in the day after it has warmed up since it can run pretty slowly towards in the morning. *Although this looks like a wooden coaster, it is not. It is a steel coaster.* Shoutout to one ride operator who ran to check every restraint and interacted with guests waiting in line; I didn't get his name.\n\nV2: AMAZING launch coaster. Very underrated and unique as the layout was altered due to the park's height limit. Had no line.\n\nBoomerang: Smooth for a Vekoma Boomerang but might hurt your back (only for a short amount of time). Line was nonexistent.\n\nCobra: Didn't ride; train wasn't even on the tracks.\n\nRoadrunner Express: Tiny children's coaster, what more can I say?\n\nThey have an alright flat ride collection however I didn't ride many. Wonder Woman is brand new and is pretty fun but almost made me sick. Tasmanian Devil almost got me sick as well. Don't ride after eating. Hammerhead Shark is a very sketchy ride but pretty fun. Ride Thrilla Gorilla; it's hilariously weird. Arctic Adventure, their 4D theater, is laughably bad. The pre-show has nothing to do with the ride and the ride itself is super short. The movie is awful - the animation is grotesque and the theater itself smelled like garbage. A very outdated system. Mass Effect at California's Great America about 1.5 hours south is MILES better.\n\nI didn't see many animals but from what I did see, I was somewhat impressed. The penguins were cute and the stingrays are cool to look at. They also attracted many small children. The butterfly exhibit was very well done. The sharks were pretty cool as well.\n\nThis park is extremely dirty and littered with advertisements, but hey, that's Six Flags.\n\nI did not buy food at this park since I didn't want to spend too much money but the food court overlooks a lake which is quite nice. There was also a fair bit of merchandise so I spent a few dollars on a shot glass to add to my collection.\n\nThis park gets boring quite fast. We found ourselves wandering around the park not knowing what to do.\n\nThe parking lot is very far away from the park but luckily there is a free shuttle bus to the park itself.\n\nOverall an alright park. The best thing about it is the coaster collection. If you come to the Bay Area and are deciding between California's Great America and this, choose Great America, even if you are a roller coaster enthusiast like I am. You'll enjoy that park much more.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 22, 2018", 4.0, "Very entertaining, can use some minor work", "It is fun to spend the day at Six Flags, we have annual passes, and we actually bought the annual cards for photos and for food, but never seem to find them.\nSince the cards has to be with you, and can not just be added to your annual pass, we practically lost the value of what we paid for.\nIt is not their fault that we lost it, but it would have been nice that when we purchase something annually, just add it to our card.\nThe Dolphin show is very nice, one of the most attractions along with the tigers show that my son enjoyed.\nThere is a piece of the place we were never able to find, it is somewhere to the west south end, near the giraffe, but we couldn't find it (maybe it was always closed when we are there?)

We went the day after Christmas. Overall, the wait wasn't so bad. The area for smaller kids looked really fun; but other rides looked somewhat rundown.

Every single time, I find myself wondering why I wasted my time/money to go to Six Flags. First, I pay a TON of money to park my car (as much as $35 to park in the Preferred section of the parking lot), then I pay a hearty amount to get into the park. After that, I usually buy a Flash Pass, because the length of lines at Six Flags can get to be absurdly long. To rub salt in the wounds of paying for that Flash Pass, they often tell you which seats you can sit in after you pay that princely sum of money for the Flash Pass....and it usually excludes the front and back seats. Then I pay a fortune for greasy, cold, gross food and over the course of the day, I just get bombarded by advertisement after advertisement, and constant, endless attempts to get me to spend more money. Jake, get a season dining pass! Jake, upgrade today's ticket to a season pass! Jake, get a season parking pass! Jake, come ride the Polar Springs Plunge, sponsored by Polar Springs water...and then come ride the Merry-Go-Round, sponsored by Skittles! Don't forget to eat this (brand I've never heard of) because it's the Official Ketchup of Six Flags!!! Jake, will you be requiring oxygen during your visit today? Get a Season Oxygen Pass so you don't have to hold your breath all day long! After all of this crap, I have to endure ridiculously slow dispatch times on the roller coasters and thrill rides and put up with the bad attitudes of a bunch of lazy employees working in the park that don't want to be there. And don't forget that the hottest ride in the park is closed for the next few weeks/months because Six Flags doesn't keep many of the basic spare parts for its rides on hand like it should...or because they decided to do the annual maintenance on the ride in the middle of the season, instead of during the off-season when the park is closed or attendance is low. Oh, and did I mention how dirty and run down the park is? It just gets EXHAUSTING.\n\nAll of that went away on my first visit to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom 9 days ago. Yes, parking was INSANELY expensive. Yes, the park was busy. Yes, it wasn't the cheapest price to get in for the day...especially for the short time period the park was going to be open. But this time, something was different. The employees were all AWESOME. I mean that. They were AWESOME. They were friendly, quick to check restraints and dispatch rides, they had great attitudes and all acted like they were actually happy to be there and having a great time. The park was clean. CLEAN!!! I didn't see any trash anywhere the entire day I was there, and the trash cans weren't overflowing like they often are. I visited a few of the animal shows and was pleasantly surprised with the quality and entertainment value they presented. My Premium Flash Pass got me on almost all of the rides I wanted with not more than 5 minute wait times (for lines that were easily running an hour or longer)....and best of all, I was allowed to pick the seat I wanted!\n\nRide selections at the park weren't bad. Since this is a smaller Six Flags (and not a HUGE Six Flags like the ones in LA, Chicago, Texas or NJ) and since they are subject to 150' tall height restrictions for their rides, they didn't have some of the extreme rides as some of their sister parks. That being said, their ride selection (especially coasters) is pretty solid. There's plenty for the thrill-seekers, and 2 smaller coasters for the kids. It's seriously a well-rounded park for all ages and is perfect for families. Don't like the rides? Go see one of the animal shows! Bored with the animal shows? Go ride the big coasters!\n\nI did have a few gripes about my visit to the park, and they are gripes that I see other reviewers mentioning too. I didn't eat during my visit, because the lines for the dining establishments (even quick-service food stands) were HUGE. I wanted to get in line for a burger/fries at Johnny Rocket's and was told the line was 1.5 hours long. TO GET FOOD. Those lines NEVER died down, either. EVERY food establishment had HUGE lines for the ENTIRE DAY. Because of this, Six Flags missed out on money from not only me, but from lots of other people that gave up too. Also, a few of the major rides were closed for refurbishment. Okay, I understand that early November is the off-season, but why would you close these rides for 4-6 weeks with the holiday rush coming up? Why not wait until January to close them and do the necessary off-season maintenance?\n\nGripes aside, I had a wonderful day at the park and I would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about making a visit. Shop around online and look for deals on entry tickets and other coupons from Six Flags to save money. And yes, the Platinum Flash Pass is worth every penny if you're going to ride and you've got the money to spend on it (which tends to be higher than the cost of admission to the park).\n\nBravo to the management of Six Flags Discovery Kingdom. I don't know what you're doing that's different than your sister parks, but it needs to spread chain-wide. I had a great time and congrats on a job well done!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 15, 2017", 3.0, "Good rides / Greasy cold food", "I visited the park this past Sunday with my wife and two kiddos. We had a lot of fun on the rides as the lines were relatively short. The park was clean and, for the most part, the staff was helpful and friendly.\n\nMy gripe is the food! We spent over $100 for lunch and had awful pizza, lukewarm Chinese food and hot wings that tasted more like vinegar wings. The lines for the food were exceptionally long. We split up so everyone could get what they wanted and we each waited about 30-40 minutes in line. The park food service staffing seemed to be out of sync with the size of the crowd. (I\u2019ve been to this park on much busier days and not waited as long for food.)\n\nAnyway, not sure what happened Sunday but the food experience was not ideal.

There was a few big thrill rides, and lots of smaller rides for the kids. We mostly were there for the zoo, but a lot of the exhibits were shut down though. The few that were open, were really run down and needed updating. Felt really sad. We got a great deal on tickets, so I thought it was worth the $33/person (included lunch) I paid. But I would\u2019ve been upset if I paid much more.\n\nWe did see two shows, the tiger and the dolphin show. Those were really fun. The dolphin show was especially amazing. We also really enjoyed the Butterfly Grove.\n\nIf you go to this park expecting it to be a spectacular zoo, or an amazing amusement park like the Six Flags in Southern California, you\u2019ll be disappointed. If you have a lot lower expectations, and expect something a little bit smaller, like Gilroy Gardens (which I think is way better), then you\u2019ll probably like this place.

We planned well ahead, got dated tickets from Fathers\u00b4 Day sale, including parking ticket and tickets for Dolphin discovery for children. Printed all at home, no need to stand in line for tickets at the gate. The dolphin discovery was a blast for the kids, the park delivered all they promised on website including dolphin feeding, petting, training and a dorsal fin ride, all under close supervision of a number of friendly staff. The park itself is extensive and the shows perform one after another on a tight schedule but quite far away from each other. You need to really plan your visit ahead at home so as not to waste time during your day of visit. You need to decide how much time you want to spend at the shows and how much on the rides - be prepared to split the family as many rides have age and height limitations AND you must put all your bags and purses in lockers (paid) or leave them with non-riding family members. Most family rides are wheelchair accessible and the staff is ready to help with getting on and off the ride.\nWe chose a Friday in August for our visit and the crowds were relatively small, the longest wait for a ride was about 10 minutes.

Three of the food restaurants were closed. The open ones only had one or two, if lucky, open windows and were under staffed. The cashier would take order, wait for order to be made, then serve before taking next order. Very slow and inefficient. Food wait times were from 60-90 minutes.

OK OK so I visited once before when it was called Six Flags Marine World. That was about a dozen years ago. I honestly don't remember everything about that trip (like did I even ride Roar?), but I do remember the crowd was pretty light and that was also at the same time of year during Fright Fest.\n\nSince my last visit, the park has made some excellent additions and the crowds sure seem to have swelled. Just pulling off the I-80 there was already a line of cars. We probably should have arrived earlier, but I underestimated the drive from Sunnyvale and the size of the crowd on this warm Saturday in September.\n\nBy the way, $25 for parking? Good thing we have gold season passes. It's a little weird that I was able to get our 2017 gold passes from SFDK's web site for only $50 (gold includes parking). Something about that ratio seems off. Granted I purchased during their flash sale.\n\nPro tip: The price you pay for season passes depends on your initial SF park. That's the park you have to visit first to process your pass. Since we already had this trip planned, we saved $22 per pass by renewing through SFDK instead of SFMM (gold passes are valid at all parks).\n\nI was tempted to splurge for the Flash Pass but it just didn't make sense for the rides I truly cared about. The catalyst for our trip was The Joker and to a lesser extent Superman Ultimate Flight. As the Flash Pass attendant explained (and this seems to conflict with their web site), the gold/platinum pass gets you a one-time use at Joker whereas SUF requires platinum and it's also one-time use. I didn't want to pay $90 for essentially two rides.\n\nAnyway, despite a fairly crowded day, we had a pretty good time highlighted by Joker and Superman. Sure I would have liked a lighter crowd in order to ride Joker more than once. But that's what happens when you practically give away your season passes. OK on to the rides.\n\nMedusa - This was the star attraction on my 2002-ish visit. It's still a fun ride and my favorite of the two floorless roller coasters in California. I love the straight drop. We were assigned to the second row but luckily ended up in the first row.\n\nSkyScreamer - As a coaster nut, I tend to ignore the flat rides, but we rode this since I've never been on a Star Flyer before. It was fun. Definitely worth it if the wait is decent.\n\nDare Devil Chaos Coaster - Not really my cup of tea and we both walked away with a bit of nausea. I mostly rode it because, although these Larson Fire Ball rides are a long time staple at carnivals across the country, I don't think I've actually ever been on one. We found it interesting to watch the ride operator since she actually manually controls the ride for the most part.\n\nDolphin Harbor - We grabbed a couple of frozen strawberry cups and caught the dolphin show that happened to be starting soon. It was a nice way to take a break in the shade and let the nausea dissipate.\n\nPacific Rim 5D - This just happened to be near the Dolphin Harbor rear exit. Wow was this terrible. In stark contrast to Mass Effect New Earth at California's Great America, the picture quality was horrible. They basically took a battle scene from the movie and shoved it into a 4D type of experience. I'm glad it was only showing in 2D when we went.\n\nThe Joker - Like I said, this was the reason for the visit and it did not disappoint. We lucked out and were assigned to the front row of the last car. From the top of the lift to the brake run, Joker is all kinds of awesome with airtime galore. It's only my second Rocky Mountain Construction creation and it reaffirms the fact that I must travel to ride them all. Do yourself a favor and seek out your closest RMC stat. The Joker alone is reason enough for me to come back here one day.\n\nSuperman Ultimate Flight - This was my first time (finally) checking out a Sky Rocket II.

From classics like Superman, through the short but excellent V2, and the simply stunning new Joker ride. The park is pretty compact and we easily got around all the \"big\" coasters in the morning without any real queues to speak of.\n\nHowever we then got caught up in a painfully slow queue waiting for the White Water Safari. It was excruciating to watch boat after boat (each of which takes 12 people) being sent off with 2, 3 or 4 people. The teenagers in charge simply could not fathom that you need to group people together to get as close to 12 in each boat as possible. The queue which took 45 minutes could have seriously taken 10 or 15 if they just managed loading better.\n\nAfter that sadly the park had gotten busier and there are no displays or indicators of queue times which is highly frustrating as a customer.

While they were all decent in general terms (and the dolphin show was one of the best I've seen) I now have a moral objection to these kinds of exhibits. It simply isn't fair to the animals unless they are rescue animals which can't be released back into the wild. Without any obvious way to verify this I felt uneasy in these exhibits.\n\nI also felt the multi-layered \"flash pass\" offerings are capitalism taken much too far. Regular (which is just a reservation system), Gold and Platinum are available with Platinum an incredible $110 per person. I truly believe reservations should be free - parks make more money while you \"virtually\" queue in the park itself, it simply doesn't make sense to charge for this level.\n\nSo overall a good day out, however I'd hate to visit when it's actually high season, the poor queue management would mean you'd have to invest as a minimum in the $65 Gold flash pass, which starts to get expensive quickly...\n\nOh and ditch those animal exhibits, unless they truly are rescue animals (in which case make this clear so customers who care about animal welfare can visit the park without feeling morally dubious!).\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 25, 2016", 4.0, "Season pass\u2026 Buyer Beware", "We bought a great deal on season passes on Labor Day weekend 2016. $52 (approximately) for 2017 season pass, plus season pass for the rest of 2016, which includes their Fright Fest admission and Holiday Lights extravaganza.
