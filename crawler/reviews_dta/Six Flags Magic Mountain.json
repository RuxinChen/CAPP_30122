However, if you're not a big coaster fan, you may find yourself a bit on the bored side, as coasters are the major offering and draw for this park.\n\nMagic Mountain is a 262-acre park that is located in Valencia, CA (kind of out in the middle of nowhere, about an hour north-northwest of Los Angeles), just off of Interstate 5. As of January 1, 2018, it is open 365 days per year. Parking is plentiful, with HUGE parking lots and shuttle bus service to lead you from your parking spot to the front gate. It is a VERY busy park; crowds can be unbelievably overwhelming! The worst I have seen it is at 95% capacity, with almost no place to park and lines for all of the major rides running at 2-3 hours and everything else at an hour minimum, including kiddie rides. If you are going, I cannot recommend getting a Flash Pass (Six Flags' front-of-line system) enough. Seriously, depending on crowds, you may find yourself only going on 4-5 rides over the entire course of the day if you attend on an especially busy day. Crowds can be OUTRAGEOUS!\n\nThe park is built on the side of a hill; that means you will be doing a lot of walking uphill and downhill over the course of your day. Yes, it gets tiring traversing all of those hills if you aren't in decent shape! Good, comfortable footwear that offers plenty of cushion and support is an absolute MUST!!! You will likely find yourself walking upwards of 10 miles over the course of your day, so protect your feet! Walking paths are plentiful and easily traversable if you are on a scooter. Guests in a wheelchair are going to need people who are fit and able to push them if they don't have the upper-body strength to push themselves up the hills.\n\nMagic Mountain has NINETEEN roller coasters. Yes, NINETEEN (as of this writing in February, 2018). Let that sink in! And of those 19 coasters, many of them are outstanding and truly top of their class. You want to ride an incredible flying coaster? They've got it: Tatsu. Hungry for the best stand-up coaster on earth? Riddler's Revenge, Baby! Looking for hyper coaster (200' tall, non-looping steel coaster) with some fun air time? Goliath. Want to ride something super unique that you won't find anywhere else in the USA? X2, Twisted Colossus, Green Lantern: First Flight and Full Throttle. Got kids and you want to start their thrill rider training program? Magic Mountain has FIVE kiddie and family coasters that are perfect for little ones to cut their teeth on and transition to the bigger rides. However, if you're not the biggest coaster and thrill ride fan on the planet, you are going to find the ride offerings to be a bit on the weak side. Six Flags has been focusing their attention on building rides other than coasters over the past few years, including a 400+ foot drop tower, an impressive (and fun) interactive dark ride themed to DC Comics' Justice League, as well as some new and old school carnival-type rides. There are around 10 kiddie rides for your youngsters...but that's about it. If you're not into coasters or rides, about the only other thing for you to do (besides see some tacky shows) is spend your day in the water park, Hurricane Harbor, but that requires a separate admission and is not included with your Magic Mountain admission.\n\nMagic Mountain is a typical Six Flags park, so you are going to find things needing paint, trash on the ground and advertisements EVERYWHERE (eat a Nathan's Hot Dog, the Official hot dog of Six Flags!; come visit Fright Fest, sponsored by Snickers!; come ride the Full Throttle Coaster, brought to you by Corn Nuts!, etc. They even will wrap their shuttle busses and coaster trains in vinyl advertising wraps. It gets EXHAUSTING). Your admission is just the start of the money they want you to spend. Why would you park in the back of the parking lot when you can get PREFERRED PARKING for just $15 more! Why come for only one day when you can come ALL SUMMER LONG with a season pass for just another $30! Don't forget to add on a Season Dining Pass to eat all summer long too! And you would be silly not to add on Season Parking while you're at it? Why wait in line when you can get a Flash Pass today! Oh, you have items that you are carrying with you? You'll have to place those in a locker...and those lockers aren't free. EVERYWHERE you look, they are trying to charge you for something. This is something that Disney does at their parks, but Six Flags can't come close to competing with Disney and it just makes you feel dirty and violated as the day goes on. Rides are routinely closed, whether due to breakdowns, lack of staffing, or annual refurbishments. Rare is the day when you will find all of the rides open and operating. Disinterested and bored employees are everywhere and many are more interested in playing on their phones than paying attention to their jobs and their customers. The whole park--like all Six Flags parks--has a very rundown feel to it and that's a damn shame: Magic Mountain is actually a GREAT park! If they could just get on top of some of its shortcomings and round out some of its ride offerings a bit more, they could push it up to the best amusement park in the world. Don't get me wrong, I generally have a good time at Magic Mountain and it's definitely the best park in the chain, tied with Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey. Just be ready to shell out LOTS of extra dollars when you get there...or you're going to stand in punishing lines all day long and feel like a second-class citizen.\n\nCoaster lovers, Magic Mountain is your Mecca! Non-coaster lovers, there are better parks for you to visit. Spend your money on a day at Universal Studios Hollywood or Disneyland. Recommended...with concerns and reservations.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 1 week ago", 5.0, "Great park for roller coasters", "We went on Presidents' Day and had a great time. The lines weren't very long so we were able to go on all of the big coasters (except Green Lantern which was closed for maintenance) - several more than once -- and we didn't even stay until closing time. Thank goodness I didn't waste my $ on Flash Passes -- although they might be worth it for a weekend day in summer. There is a kiddie section which I am not familiar with, but this park definitely seems geared more toward the 54\" and up thrill-seekers. They have a great variety of extreme coasters -- they were all unique and fun. The staff seemed nice and to enjoy their jobs too (except one guy working at the chicken fingers & fries snack shack -- not friendly and I think he ripped me off -- didn't give me AAA discount -- and then wouldn't give me a receipt because the machine was supposedly out of paper and he couldn't generate another receipt). Anyway, overall, the park is what you'd expect of Six Flags -- fantastic rides and Looney Tunes cartoons and super hero trivia to keep you partially entertained while waiting in line. The last time I went to Magic Mountain was nearly 2 decades ago and nearly all of the coasters now have been added since then. I grew up going to Six Flags Great Adventure in NJ (and still go occasionally); while Magic Mountain appears to be a smaller park, it still has at least as many thrill coasters. If you like coasters, Six Flags is a must. Be sure to try X2, Twisted Colossus, Riddler's Revenge, Batman...pretty much all of them; Ninja was least favorite -- most boring of the bunch.

Boarded up areas and restaurants (not just those they were being currently worked on), areas and rides and queues in need of attention (cleaning, maintenance, painting). While we were there several restaurants and shops never opened (again maybe just because it\u2019s off season).

My son has been looking at park maps, videos and reviews of each roller coaster for months and has memorized the stats of each coaster so we figured it was time to make the 2\u00bd flight to LA to visit Magic Mountain. We visited during off-peak and based on reviews on Yelp and TripAdvisor, I expected rides to be closed and the park to be dirty but that was NOT the case.

You can buy it on the day so in off peak season I would wait to buy it - apparently in summer/peak season it is a good investment.\n\nPaid for parking - $25 dollars I think? But I don't think there is anywhere really to park outside that is a reasonable distance.\n\nObviously being off season a lot of the shops etc were closed. So there was only like two main places to get something to eat from.\n\nFood and beverage wise - in comparison to Disneyland it was a lot more expensive. A large drink at Disneyland was around $5 and here it was a bit over $7.. We paid around $50 for a baked potato, burger with a tiny amount of chips, large soft drink and a bottle of water.\n\nThe park has wifi - which is a benefit for tourists with no international roaming plan.\n\nThe park itself was clean - I didn't see any rubbish lying around.\n\nDefinitely NOT a theme park and I wouldn't bring any young kids (probably under 10). There is no characters around and it is strictly for those who love rollercoasters. There really isn't much for younger children to do.

The free upgrade to Gold status grants free season parking and makes all of these benefits (parking, entry, and meal plan) available at Magic Mountain and other Six Flags properties. We drove down to Six Flags Magic Mountain for the long MLK weekend. The park hours were short (10:30-6:00 everyday) which made the 10 minute early entry for Gold pass holders even more important. There were large lines at the entrance gates at least half an hour before the park opened. Once inside, the crowds dissipated significantly, but being in the park before the masses helped us knock off a couple of the big rides, like Full Throttle and Tatsu before there were lines at all.\n\nSeveral of the rollercoasters were out of service the weekend we visited, and we heard from staff that that will be a regular occurrence now that the park is open 365 days per year. Although we were disappointed not to ride some of the rollercoasters due to scheduled maintenance, there were still many rides if you are at least 48 inches tall. However, even my daughter, who is 42 inches tall, rode Ninja with one of us on what seemed like an infinite cycle, while the other parent escorted the two 48 inchers on the larger thrill rides. The other solid family entertainment ride for 42 inchers is the arcade-style shooting ride (Justice League: Battle for Metropolis), which everyone enjoyed, but which broke down several times during our three day visit.\n\nThree areas in which Magic Mountain has room for improvement are in (1) the entertainment programming offered (zero live shows scheduled for a holiday weekend? Really?); (2) the reported wait times in the Six Flags app (often WAY off, and inconsistently available, to the point of being almost useless); and (3) missed opportunities to capitalize on thematic elements (you can do so much more than just name rides after superheroes).\n\nAnother tip: be sure to wear earplugs\u2014 the comfortable kind you can wear all day. Many rides and even the park\u2019s \u201cbackground music\u201d are ear-splittingly loud. It is much more pleasant with earplugs, and you can still hear everything you are supposed to hear.\n\nAlso, a caution: X2 in particular is quite rough. It slammed my daughter\u2019s head into the shoulder restraint so hard she was in tears for the second half of the ride. So, just because you are tall enough to ride doesn\u2019t mean that the restraints will fit you quite like an adult. Even if you are an adult, the ride can still be quite rough \u2014 the \u201cpadded\u201d shoulder harnesses feel more like a brick than foam.\n\nStill, the trip to visit Magic Mountain for these Discovery Kingdom regulars was worth the drive.

We started early in the day, which helped reduce the wait for many rides.

Bags or purses must be left on a rack on the far side of the ride cars, which then makes them accessible when existing down the stairs.

A medical tech did come and check me out. Since I didn't lose consciousness, I was deemed OK and agreed that I was not in need of emergency assistance. I waited in the seating area with my grandkids while their parents took the ride, as I wouldn't let them leave without their ride. My surprise came when it was time to leave.

This review is regarding the experience I had as a tourist many years later.\n\nSix Flags Magic Mountain has the most roller coasters of anywhere in the world. This is accurate, but a few caveats:\n\n1) The number is inflated by an abnormal amount of small childrens' coasters (four in total)\n2) The collection is not as well-renowned as say, Cedar Point\n3) This park is miserable to be at\n\nDespite its idyllic mountain setting, this Six Flags takes its famous status and uses it as an excuse for poor maintenance, capacity, appalling upkeep and refusal to provide good service. Waits for food are unbelievably long, and despite sweltering heat only two places on property (near each other) offer escape in A/C. When I went into one of the large gift shops towards the front, the cashier had no idea where else I could find somewhere to relax and cool down. I then spotted a corner of the store where people were actually squatting, and I joined them in an attempt to not suffer from heat stroke.\n\nThe coasters are obviously the reason to go, and while the park has plenty, there are only a few highlights: Twisted Colossus, an insanely fun and quick RMC redo of an old classic; Full Throttle, a smooth launch coaster with a massive loop; Tatsu, an amazingly intense flying coaster. The rest are either clones of past B&M coasters (Scream, Batman), bizarre unique coasters (the mind-obliterating X2, Superman) or ones past their prime (Apocalypse, Viper, Goliath, Ninja). The combination of rough, intense and gimmicky (Revolution's VR, for example) attractions, a hilly, expansive terrain and humid temperatures can create for exhausting experience.\n\nA minor respite would be the new Justice League: Battle for Metropolis, an indoor 3D interactive dark ride that's admittedly impressive and on a Disney-ish level. Even better, it provides 15 to 20 solid minutes in beautiful air conditioning. There is also a small Cirque-like show in A/C as well.\n\nYet these only improve your time there by minimal leaps. The restrooms are dirty, the buildings are in poor shape, tacky with advertising and frankly it doesn't feel like the employees care about your existence whatsoever. It's the prime example of coasting on its own bravado and not caring about anything else.

Since Universal has been dissapointing in the past years i chose six flags this year. You need three things before you think your ready for this night.\n1. Regular ticket for the entrance. I got the season past since i come here at least twice a year for the rides. $80 (season pass varies from $85-$270)\n2. Maze pass $17 fast pass $27 (DON'T RECCOMEND)\n3. Parking ticket $25 or (exception you get dropped off/Under) $65 season parking.\n\nOnce there if you get the season pass you need to go to the pass holder office to get your pass. If you purchase the maze pass online, DON'T forget your maze pass which you can only get near the stroller/lost and found building. If you did not purchase your maze pass online then you can purchase your maze pass at any shop. THIS WAS NOT TOLD TO ANYONE.\nThere is an app to better help guide through the park but i uninstalled it soon after, it was unless confusing and it did not have the fright fest maze map to help me out. When i finally found a maze about an hour or so later im told to show my wrist maze pass? I had the ticket on my phone for the maze but i was told i needed the wrist pass. I was told to go to the shop all the way down the tiring downhill road (the maze was next to the superman ride) only to be told when i arrived that the only place to get a wrist pass that was purchased online is by the main entrance/lost and found. Unless i wanted to buy new maze pass tickets! WHAT! I didnt feel as bad when i realized i was not the only person not enjoying this night, there was several people also confused on the lack of organization. After three hours wasted i now had my wrist pass and was now all the way back in the main entrance. It is now 10:00pm and i have about three hours to enjoy what i can. I only got to attend two mazes and one freefall ride. The food and atmosphere is the same as a regular day at six flags.\nIn conclusion, I spent more money coming here, I honestly DID NOT have a pleasant time here for fright fest. I will come here once in a great time during the day just to enjoy the rides. But i gave this a chance and it was bad. Perhaps the Queen Mary next year.

There are so many problems with this park outside of the roller coasters that extra preparation is definitely recommended.\nFirst off, this park is huge, but not only is it huge, but it is also very hot and a lot of the park is placed right on the slopes of a large hill. This wouldn't be so bad if there would be a much better convenience with shade and misters, so before you enter the park, make sure you have a plastic water bottle so you can refill all day long without having to worry about paying for a regular or souvenir cup.\nSecondly, this park feels pretty ghetto, even without the crowd of LA teens. An amusement park should feel like another world, but many places in the park felt cheap, dirty, unkempt, etc.\nFinally, the food. I've been to dozens of amusement parks across the country, but this park is definitely in the bottom 3 when it comes to food. They normally serve the food either cold, stale, undercooked, or just bad.\nOverall, I recommend this as a coaster-only park as the roller coasters (and some other rides) are absolutely the only reason to keep coming back.\n\n(Note: Ride Twisted Colossus.

Six Flags offers so many rollercoasters, all cool, scary or unique in their own way. My favorite rollercoasters were Tatsu and Superman: Escape from Krypton. Tatsu is the longest and tallest \"flying\" rollercoaster in the world. Whilst riding it, I literally believed that I was flying through the air. I loved Superman because the ride was so fast and the acceleration was just unbelievable: On Superman, you accelerate from 0-100mph in only seven seconds!\n\nOther than the awesome rides, something else worth mentioning, is the flash pass. When my father, sister and I last went to Magic Mountain, we had flash passes. And honestly, we didn't regret purchasing them, even if we spent more money. They can make your visit at Six Flags much more exciting, especially when the park is crowded with loads of people! Thanks to the flash passes, we could ride 10 rollercoasters in a couple hours, and waited much less than most people did.\n\nOn the other hand, what I disliked the most was the heat. In the theme park, the temperature was really high, about 90F (35\u00b0) and we always had stop to take a break in between and drink lots of water.

It was fun, but not like a usual coaster. It's kind of like a ribbon folded on top of itself and it does bounce around and toss the rider around (the seat does spin completely around). I was a little intimidated but I was glad I did ride. Make sure you're secured tight because it threw me forward hard and I felt kind of wedged in the tiny bit of space left.

You life face down, and once you get over the fear of that harness opening up, it's like flying.

It looked like a kiddie coaster, but definitely was not. It ran along the ground a large part of the way, but the speed and twisting track had my heart racing.\nFull Throttle - Never been on a coaster quite like this. The loop seems much bigger when you go over the top of it than when you're looking at it from the ground. Riders are shot out of the station through the inside of the loop. You drop around a corner and stop inside a tunnel which then shoots you back halfway up through the drop, and when you come back through the tunnel shoots the coaster super fast over the outside/top of the loop. The coaster brakes very hard coming down the side of the loop into the station. When you experience this ride for the first time, you don't know what to expect and it's quite thrilling.\nGrand American Carousel - A very nice carousel I really enjoyed riding.\nThe New Revolution Galactic Attack - This coaster was a new experience also. Riders can choose to wear a virtual reality helmet. It has a Samsung phone over the eye area that plays out a galactic scene while the coaster is in motion. I thought it was super well done. Riders could turn their heads in the direction they wanted the coaster to go. It was an experience like I've never had before. I really enjoyed that one.\nViper - I believe this is one of the older coasters in the park, so I wasn't too nervous, but this one is no joke.

X2, Tatsu, Superman and Twisted Colossus are the best rides, only thing I didn't like was that the park was very Hilly (i guess the name of the park gives that away.)so by the end of the day my legs were tired from walking up and down, but then you can always get the Orient Express train up the hill. I'f some of the coasters weren't clones of other rides in six flags parks this would be rated the same as Cedar Point in my Honest Opinion.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 5, 2017", 4.0, "Summer vacation", "The one thing I suggest is to stay closer than we did because the freeway it is located off of seems to always be busy. When we went the waiting times for rides weren't too bad all in all. Unfortunately it is very warm there this summer. Was around 100 + degrees every day we visited. My son really liked all the rides. He was disappointed because the Riddler was closed off due to them building another ride close to it. Maybe you could have it open during peak months and work on it in the fall/winter when less people are there.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 4, 2017", 5.0, "Great coaster park!", "I went here with adult only group. We went on a Friday and surprisingly the park on the rides side was not that crowded. I think it was in part due to the recent heat wave. The X2 was the most intense of the coasters. Drinks and food a little on the pricey side as expected in these parks. Overall the group had a blast and would go again.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 4, 2017", 5.0, "Mom", "Excellent trip, the lines were short, the rides were great and the sandwich by kwerks delicious. The show at kwerks is amazing."], ["Reviewed July 3, 2017", 3.0, "Great rides but let's itself down by poor management", "Came here for three days as part of our holiday. The difference between 6 flags and say Disney or Universal is the lack of detail. It's functional. If 6 flags was a room then the curtains would have no tie backs, and there'd be no cushions on the settee!\nThe good points are that if you like rollercoasters this is the place for you. There are 19 making it the largest number in one park in the world and obviously some of them are right up there as great rides. The staff generally we found to be good as well, polite, helpful and on our last day the staff at twisted colossus were doing their best to get the trains going as quickly as possible so that you can duel (i.e. Two of you go round separate tracks at the same time) Another staff member offered us water proof bags for our phones on the roaring rapids which she'd bought herself!\nNow the bad points. Very little else other than roller coasters. No single riders queue (line) plus the staff seem unwilling or not allowed to organise the people to fill up the empty seats. For example the log flumes can contain 6 people but often just 2 occupied each one even when the queue was up to an hour long. The Flash pass people (pay to jump the queues) go straight to the front of the line and so tend to take the front or back row seats. The park doesn't open until 1030am most days, even in the height of summer. The season pass, whilst better value if you're visiting three or more times runs for a calendar year and not for a year. I.E it expires Dec 31st regardless of when you buy it. They sell a day/season photo pass but most of the rides don't have a photo option on them.\nOverall, some great coasters, but little else\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 29, 2017", 1.0, "Bad Experience with Customer Services", "I will just post the letter I sent to this company but I never got a response!\n\nDear Sirs, I want to help you improve your quality service with my complaint. Today (May 29th, 2016) I bought two Flash Passes to enjoy my day at your park. In general your service is good. But today, after making a reservation to ride on Ninja at 4:27, I arrived 5 minutes before. The ride was supposed to leave before my due time, I was asked to wait patiently for the next ride. I said ok no Problem. There were other clients complaining that about the lack of information about the rules and so forth. I just waited there. At 4:35 after waiting the other ride of the common clients, I was allowed to get in to sit. In the meantime, your employees (Leslie, Destiney and another lady) were chatting. I supposed they are your representatives who are responsible for guiding customers, right. Here comes the problem, I was sitting on front row but only after everyone was sat on their places, your employees told me I was not allowed to sit on those places. I was sitting there with my son. I was asked to get out to my surprise all seats seemed to be taken. I said that was not proper work and that I wanted to register a complaint. At this moment your employee tried to ignored me and move along side.\n\nOn my fault I extended my arms and touch her lightly with my arm. Lesley invented that I hold her by the shoulder and all your employees hide behind a lie to call security to removed me from the place. They asked me to wait until security arrived. I waited to explain the event. After talking to security, I was advised to keep my day riding other machines but not the Ninja. I was so upset that I then went to Guest Relations to make a complaint.\n\nYour other employee Tracy pretended to hear my case saying that she will record my complaint. When I went back to read the complaint then she said it was not done. Requested my ID to register the complaint but then I said I will just send you an\ne-mail. I am writing this because your people are just not treating people properly. Good luck with your park which by the way is amazing.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 29, 2017", 2.0, "Needs Help", "First they are able to change the time that the park opens at their leisure. We looked on line that the park opens at 10am., however, they didn't open until 10:30am. The first two rides we went to ride were closed. This park seems run down. Junky store offerings. While waiting in line for rides in the areas that are off limits to riders; there is trash everywhere. It looks terrible. We have been all over the United States to amusement parks and this is the trashiest/dirtiest park. They need to take time before and after the park closes to clean up the grounds. Also, I have never been to a park where you have to park your vehicle behind the park and walk all the way around the outside to the gate. Very strange. But, there is a shaded tree area with picnic tables where your family can have lunch,a snack or relax for a moment before walking all the way around the park again to go back in.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 28, 2017", 2.0, "HAVEN'T BEEN THERE IN A LONG TIME", "We went 2 a funeral in Avenal and were coming back, we were going 2 spend the night at Casltic Lake so we decided 2 go 2 Six Flags....we forgot how expensive it was, forget about the food, but wat they charge extra 2 get on the rides ..loved the funnel cakes, and taking pictures with the characters\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 28, 2017", 5.0, "Thrilled", "I really do like this kind of parks!

When got there, it was $23 to park. The lot is located quite far away from the actual park entrance. We got there early so we had to wait at the entrance gate and things were quite disorganized for getting people into the park. It was quite hot out as well, which we expected; however, there weren't a lot of shaded relief areas and many of the misters did not work. On this particular day, the line ups were quite long. We waited about 45 minutes to ride New Revolution which in my opinion was not worth it. The graphics were shockingly poor with the VR headset. The food and drink was very expensive (a vending machine soda for $4.50). It seemed like this park had seen better days and could use some TLC and cleaning. I would not return again; I would much rather go to Disneyland when I'm in Southern California based on this experience.\nShow less"]]}}
