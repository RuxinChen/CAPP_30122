Has 222 sites (there are some sites that have full hookup). Has restrooms, water spickets every few lots, a small store (in case you forgot anything), shaved ice and most of the sites are fairly large in size. You book them 6 months out, but book early (basically right when your 6 month window opens) as they are reserved quickly. We saw a few people when we were there that were squatting at the check-in waiting for cancellations.\n\nThe campground is on a bluff with stairways down to the beach (with a ramp on the south side). This was our last chance to get away with the grandkids before back to school (remember how that felt?). We were lucky enough to get our favorite site (#206) once again. This site has stairs down to the beach right next to it and super convenient to take breaks for lunch, dinner etc.\n\nSo each day - up and down those stairs lots of times. Beautiful weather and a great time in and out of the water. Seems like a lot of the campers just like to stay up top so minimal amount of people - not that many for socal in the summer.Fun for all.
