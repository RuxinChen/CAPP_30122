Great location downtown LA near a nice square with shops, restaurants and bright LA lights. It was a week before the All-Star Weekend comes to town, so they were busy getting things prepared, but that didn't take any focus away from the Clippers that night. As I walked in through security, I passed by all the iconic statues outside the arena: Jerry West, Gretzky, the new Shaq statue, Magic Johnson, Kareem, etc. Truly amazing to see in person. If you've ever been to the ACC in Toronto, that's all I've got to compare this to so keep that in mind. It seemed a lot smaller than the ACC but the seating was closer to the court and more gradual inclination. As a result, the row directly in front of me was too close and blocked our views more than it would at any other stadium. With that being said though, I definitely felt closer to the court and the action, which was great. I got the tickets off StubHub for next to nothing and wayyyyy less than face value.

We are sort of stuck in as much as some events we can only see there. I really can't stand going there at this point, it only gets worse every time. The parking, the service, the food, and the lack of women's bathrooms is terrible and they don't care. They think they have a captive audience. I have taken to driving out of town to see the same event just to avoid the misery that is Staples Center.\n1. Parking: The pricing is crazy, it can be anywhere from 25 to 50$ depending on the event. If you are handicapped, but not wheel chair bound you are going to be miserable by the time you get to the venue. They will try to force you to park in these structures that are at least a block walk from the venue. This is illegal and I have just about had it. There are spaces right in front of the venue, none handicapped marked and filled with God knows who, but not the people that need those spaces. You can arrive over an hour early and it matters not. So the start of your venture to hell is arguing with the parking attendant with a handicapped pass in your hand.\n2. Getting in: If you have Flash Seats which means you get in with your credit card or Drivers License, that is going to take some time. The staff gets confused and has all but the right information. When you say you are sorry, but you had no choice offered but Flash Seats, you will be told you are wrong, that you should have gotten paper tickets. This would be wrong. Some events do not allow for e-tickets. You go with Flash Seats or you don't go. And they speak to you like you are an idiot. This is especially fun when you have a delayed child with you that just wants to get in to the event.\n3. Don't Ask Where Things are. They Don't know: Being disabled is something many of us deal with us daily. I plan my trips so I know how far I can walk and then how far I can keep walking without falling. Now, I have walked a block to get to the venue, now I am standing for 5 minutes while the staff tries to figure out Flash Seats, and the fun has just started. My child wants his face painted. I ask where is that. I am sent in the wrong direction walking around this huge venue. I ask another and am finally sent in the right direction. I pass the two staff members who insisted I go the wrong way. I mention in a calm voice, you sent me the wrong way, just so you know, some of us have a hard time walking. The response I got, \"My bad.\" WOW!!!!\n4. Don't buy food: The lines are absurd, the food is awful and the prices are absurd. I don't mind paying 10$ for a plain, little hot dog, but when it also sucks, well that is not fun. But hey, if you want hard liquor at a Children's event, no problem, have a double martini and drive your kids. Disgusting.\n5. Are Those Really Your Seats?: You get to your seats and someone else is in them. At this point I really need to sit, feet numb, child flipping out. I ask for help, no one \"does that.\" Finally an attendant shows up. He sees my tickets, that are of course, exactly where they should be. He looks at the other tickets, clearly wrong, but we are going to discuss this? No, we really are not. I need to sit down please. I am at this point begging, just let me sick down and you can figure this out. He is holding my tickets saying, \"I know you are in the right seats, but wait while I try to figure this out.\" Seriously. The people were moved where they belong (maybe had someone helped them in the first place they would have not ended up on the wrong side of the venue.
