In the heart of the main shopping area for locals and tourists alike, one now sees significant business closures with for sale and lease signs on buildings up and down State Street. Even after the crash of 2008, I don't recall seeing as many retail restaurant and retail shop vacancies as I observed on a recent overnight trip to Santa Barbara. The numerous for lease and for sale signs on store fronts detract from the overall experience of strolling down State Street. While the sidewalks are clean and shrubbery and planters are well maintained, the store fronts of the closed buildings are not well maintained with dirty and dusty windows and facades. Many of the windows of the closed buildings are taped over with brown paper, which is peeling off the windows from inside. At some point this decay will impact neighboring businesses which are still operating.\n\nTransients wander the street and on some occasions, as I observed, accosted some of the pedestrians. Although I personally did not feel threatened some might feel differently walking along State Street.\n\nI hope that Santa Barbara can find a solution to reversing the decaying shopping and dining area on mid-State Street, for it has historically been a fun experience strolling the Street.\n\nHowever, all is not lost because the Funk Zone that used to be a run down area and the place to avoid, seems to be booming now. Its located at the lower end of State Street by the beach and pier. Its definitely where the action is now, especially if the wine tasting scene appeals to you.\n\nOn the other hand, If you want to get the feel as to what strolling and shopping on State Street used to be like, travel about an hour and a half up the coast to downtown San Luis Obispo. Its the way Santa Barbara was like in the 70s and 80s.\n\nHappy travels.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 18, 2017", 4.0, "Nice place to walk around and shop/eat", "We enjoyed a morning stroll along State Street.
