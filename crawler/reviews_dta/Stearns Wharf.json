Interesting placards telling you about the history of the wharf."], ["Reviewed July 16, 2017", 3.0, "Hard to park.", "Nice but crowded, very tight traffic and small road. If you step off the sidewalk of the business your in the road and good chance to get hit.

Went to the Wharf, for the most part the restaurants we visited were overpriced and not top quality. The wine tasting concession was crowded and the young people serving you did not even say \"HI, I'll be with you in a minute\", or acknowledge out presence, although they looked right at us. It was fun to walk out and look back at Santa Barbara, but I would not recommend any services available on the Wharf.
