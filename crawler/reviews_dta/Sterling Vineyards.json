The walk winds through the various parts of the business end of the wine making with a self guided video tour that is worth pausing for as you try to pick out the parts of the video that apply to the stop you are at. The views from the second tasting stop are just draw dropping and you may want to hang there on the patio for a while in good weather.\n\nThe tour has an added unique feature in that in good weather (low wind), you can take a tram up and down the ridge from the parking lot. This gives you time to appreciate the coming views on the tasting and savor the sights until just before your departure.\n\nNo veteran discount here, but would put it on the list of must see vineyards in Calistoga.\n\nNote: This was our second attempt to tour Sterling Vineyards. The first was foiled by showing up late in the day in the fall on a Saturday where the wait for the tram was 60 min plus.

It was less crowded than Castello di Amorosa (the castle winery) across the street. Their winch service up the hill to their processing plant is a nice ride. They serve 4 wine tastings for the base price and their self guided tour is OK. The views of Napa valley from top of the hill are spectacular and is worth the price. They let you keep the wine glass as a souvenir, which is nice.\n\nPersonally, I would recommend they show more of their operations with a guided tour like some of the other wineries in the region do.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed April 3, 2017", 4.0, "Different than other vineyards", "Quite a diverse selection of wines, you'll always find at least one that would be to your liking.

View of the valley from the tram is breathtaking on a clear day. Sterling was under construction so the winemaking videos were not running and some areas were off-limits, still visitors could go around and see the \"backroom\" of winemaking.\n\nThe wine and cheese pairing was outstanding. We had three scheduled wines with great cheeses and our hostess gave us samples of two others. It was said that the finer wines offered at the wineries are only available at this site. I spent time doing a web search and found this to be generally correct. Bottom line: if there is a wine you enjoy here, buy it because you are not likely to find it elsewhere.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed March 14, 2017", 3.0, "Interesting Self Guided Tour", "Great short gondola ride from the lower parking lot to the winery. Very accommodating and pleasant staff except for the young lady at the main entrance who wouldn't check the tour selection and pricing board. The board stated $29.00 for general admission that included tram, tour and tasting. Even the website states this option with no days of the week excluded. The attendant, moderately forcefully stated that wasn't available and that we had to pay $39.00. Be solid in your understanding of what is available. The couple behind us also was charged the same as us and didn't like it either. Misrepresented.

The visit was wonderful even though the weather was a bit cool for this time of year. We love the landscape of wine country, the stories about the wineries and of course the wine. We used it as an opportunity to visit wineries to taste wines we might not have tried before. When we saw an ad for Sterling in a weekly promotional magazine we thought it might be a wonderful stop as it was at the top of a hill and they were offering a cheese plate with 2 tastings.\n\nWell what a mistake, both a waste in time and money considering the many other wineries where the experience and the wine was better.\n\nPart of their fee includes the capability to tour the winery. Only problem there was nothing to see during the self guided winery tour as it is under going a renovation. Their terrace that looks south into the Napa valley was also closed - what a disappointment as this is the prime viewing area. Because it is during the week they force you to buy their silver tasting which I guess provides a premium experience - only problem is that they crowded everyone into a small room that resulted in a sub-par experience. The tasting room was full when we got there we had to wait in another room for a while. When we finally got in, the experience was underwhelming. Lots of noise, no views servers who were so busy they really didn't have time to talk and not that knowledgeable of their wines. There was no choice of a red or mix flight - something you fine at most better wineries. When we commented that we didn't particularly like some of their wines the response was sorry but that is what we are pouring today. (Most servers at other wineries will try to help fine something that you might like.) Oh about the cheese plate, as we arrived at 12:30, the server pointed out that in the fine print it states you must be seated by 12:00 to get that. Sure enough if when we read the fine print at the bottom of the page of the ad - that is what it says.\n\nBottom line they could have done some things to make it better for visitors given they were under going construction, but didn't really try nor open to suggestions.\n\nWith all of the other great wineries in the valley do not waste your time. There are many others with equally great views, better wines and a greater sense of hospitality that you come to Napa for.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed March 7, 2017", 3.0, "Beautiful property, but deceiving experience", "We had high hopes for Sterling Vineyards and our visit. Having heard about the aerial tram trip up to the winery with incredible views peaked our interest. We went on a day with poor weather and low visibility, and accept that's just nature's luck of the draw. The disappointment and rating for this review was that the tour was under construction - two of the three large areas for tour and winery facility viewing were completely bare, simply stating they are under construction/renovation. Had we been told this, at least we could have been prepared and made an informed choice, but likely we would have chosen another time to pay $78 to see empty rooms and taste a few types of wine. We enjoyed the sample wines through the tour better than those we paid extra for on the \"reserve\" experience. Given the ample choices in the Napa Valley area, this trip felt like a deceiving spend for a relatively sub-par experience.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed March 3, 2017", 4.0, "Long lines", "While there were long lines, they moved fast.
