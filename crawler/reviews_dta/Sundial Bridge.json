Locals love to come here to hang out in the cool evenings. Musicians, street performers, and artistic types as well as new age power absorbers come and spend time on or near the bridge in the evenings. The Turtle Bay museum is close and you can see fishing boats bobbing in the current and fly fishermen wading in the river above and below the bridge. Definitely a place to come for a visit or regular walks.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 21, 2017", 5.0, "Fabulous at night (dusk).", "This is a great place and fabulous spot on summer evening.
