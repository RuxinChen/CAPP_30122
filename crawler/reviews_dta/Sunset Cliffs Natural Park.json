There are a few signs warning of unstable cliffs. There were also a few small beaches I saw people on, but did not see how they were able to get down there. I would assume with some very safe climbing. I saw a surfer with a surf board, but saw no way for him to get to the water was it was a drop off at most places. You could probably walk from one end to the other in 30 minutes or less.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed April 29, 2017", 5.0, "Sunset Cliffs", "Worth driving there! Beautiful. I didn't even plan to stay, just drove by park (all the parking was free), and enjoy a nice walk."], ["Reviewed April 26, 2017", 5.0, "Amazing...must see in San Diego!", "I tend to be cynical about \"must see\" places that end up being lackluster but let me confirm what many others have said---this is a must see site in San Diego!!!!\n\nI went on a not so busy weekday after work to watch the sunset. There were sunset yogas classes on the cliffs. The area is roughly 1 mile worth of coastline with the Pacific Ocean jutting up against it. There a unstable cliff warnings all over so mind these. My advice for those who want to walk, or jog as many did, the coastline (which I suggest); drive or have Uber drop you off at the Sunset Cliffs Nature Park and then walk the mile back. Or you can do the reverse depending on what direction you'll ultimately want to be in at the end.\n\nIt's a totally walkable coastline. There are stairs where you can walk down closer to the waves. Not many people on the small slither of beach. I enjoyed sitting on the stable cliffs and watching the sunset. I did get a little red dirt on my exercise pants but not a big deal. You can always bring something to sit on or use one of the benches scattered about.\n\nDon't forget your camera and make sure it's charged up as the views are plentiful and stunning!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed April 24, 2017", 5.0, "Dynamic Beauty", "We Floridians love the beach.

From tidal pools to wind eroded sandstone cliffs, open arches, rocky and sandy beaches and native vegetation, it can't be beat. A great bird watching beach and place for viewing surfers riding the waves, there are pull-outs all along Sunset Cliffs Blvd., each with their own unique trails and views.

They had an area called the tide pools which is really cool and you can see where the water from the seas collect and then go back out. I love going to the edges / ledges and seeing the ocean from the very edge.\nShow less"]]}}
