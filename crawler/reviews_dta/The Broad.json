The time passed quickly, but if you don't get there when it opens, or at an off-time, bring a book, or better yet, a friend with whom you'd like to talk. It was a sunny day, but we were mostly in shade when we stood in line, but there were some volunteers handing out loaner umbrellas to those people in line who were in the sun.\n\nI really enjoy looking at art, but often don't like museums. I can be overwhelmed by a museum like NYC's Metropolitan Museum of Art, for example, because it's so large and has such a diverse collection. Plus, some museums can be stuffy (I'm talking air quality, not attitude) and uncomfortable. The Broad seemed to be just the right size for me (not too much, not too little) and felt fresh (again, air quality and light), so I didn't feel like I was boxed in for most of a day. I also particularly enjoyed the windows in the main stairwell that allowed you to see the infrastructure/storage \"innards\" of the museum.\n\nThere were many works from modern art's most well-known artists: Warhol, Rauschenberg, Lichtenstein, Kruger (Barbara Kruger can not be celebrated enough for my taste!), Koons, etc., but I very much enjoyed seeing works from Malcolm Morley, Mark Tansey, Kara Walker, Mike Kelley, and especially Tauba Auerbach. I had unknowingly wandered into an exhibition of Auerbach's work in NYC a while ago, and fell hard for her lyrically mathematical style, so I was particularly delighted to see something of hers at The Broad.\n\nThe Broad is free to all, but I did spend a lot in the gift shop.

But I didn\u2019t, and clearly, that didn\u2019t stop me. I was determined to see the exhibit and museum. A tall order, I now know that.\n\nSo, we went and stood in the stand-by line like the rest of the impromptu folks \u2013 also known as the last-minute, spontaneous, hopeful, museum visitors-turned-wait-experts.\n\nI did plenty of research online before going, but it was difficult to determine what the lines would be like. Previous museum goers warned that lines would most likely be longer over the holidays and weekends, but I wished and hoped and prayed most people would be Black Friday shopping. (Damn you, Amazon. No one in L.A. was Black Friday shopping because they were all in line for The Broad.)\n\nMy mom and I showed up at 8:45am. We were able to easily park in the lot in the building \u2013 most of the parking is tandem so you\u2019ll have to leave your keys with the parking attendant if you\u2019re blocking someone.\n\nParking is $22 but you get $10 off if you get your ticket validated. I paid the full $22 because my validation ticket didn\u2019t work.\n\nPaying the full $22 was the grand finale to a very full day in line, after waiting for almost four hours. That\u2019s right! One, two, three, four\u2026 I\u2019m still in line.\n\nWe went because we wanted to see Yoyoi Kusama\u2019s Infinity Mirrored Room, which looked beautiful and worthy of a selfie while in the exhibit, but definitely not worth waiting in line for four hours. Periodically, a Broad staffer would come out, and do a count of the stand-by line. They\u2019d come out in pairs, and this would cause people to straighten up and pay attention, as if somehow their mere presence would magically move the line faster.\n\nThe line was going around the block, and I\u2019m guessing there were probably 350 people ahead of us. When we were finally almost at the front, one of the museum staff members came out to let us know they had run out of tickets for the exhibit. The woman behind me went ballistic, asking why they waited so long to give the final count and there better be a freaking manager she could speak with. I should also mention that it was around 1pm by this time, and for the lucky last people who managed to get tickets were asked to come back for their \u201cappointment\u201d to see the exhibit at 6pm. A whole five hours later! But people didn\u2019t even blink. They just eagerly nodded and handed over a credit card to pay the $30 entrance fee for the exhibit, which is going away after Jan. 1, 2018.\n\nWe got tickets and then\u2026 we were directed to stand in another line so that we could enter the building. Only in L.A., people!\n\nNow that my expectations were tainted with the 240 minutes I had spent in line, my judgement of the artwork was extra critical. I won\u2019t lie, I was still excited to go inside. It was mostly modern art, and there were a few cool things, like the giant table and chairs, and a huge mural created by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami.\n\nThe museum is really small. You could quickly go through it in about 20 minutes. I think we purposely stayed an extra half hour just shuffling around to somehow justify all that time we spent in line.\n\nAlso, the line was shaded because it was nestled between the side of the museum and the Walt Disney Concert Hall across the street. Only the front of the line was sunny, but they provided umbrellas for (Asian) patrons to avoid the harsh L.A. sunshine. So, it wasn\u2019t like we were sweating in line for four hours. Had that been the case, this would\u2019ve been a very different story.\n\nPS - Even if you reserve tickets online, you still have to wait in a separate line to get in.

We took the elevator up and got in the reservation line, not the loooong standby line.\n\nWe stood in line at 12pm to wait to get in at 12:30pm. Our objective was to get in asap. Immediately after entering the museum we turned left and walked about 30 feet towards the gift shop to find the famous Infinity Mirror Exhibit kiosk. This isn't really a kiosk, it's an iPad on a stick. Anywho, there was no line to sign up and we got our queue to line up for the room in 523 minutes. We projected that we would enter the room by 5:50pm. Since the museum closes at 8pm on Saturday, we were excited that we guaranteed our spot into the highly anticipated mirror room.\n\nNow for the art. Everything here is art. The building itself is art. The hallway leading to the 2nd floor and down to 1st floor are art. Some call it an instagram playground but if you take the time to observe and read the details for the photos and art works you'll really appreciate the depth going into each piece. You easily spend 45 mins to 2 hours there. There's quite a lot of work to see. I have to admit I had a fan girl moment when I saw some of Andy Warhol's works. The art rotates as you'll notice there is a huge storage in be basement of more artwork that isn't being displayed.\n\nNow clearly, my friends and I were not going to wait until 5:50pm for the Infinity Room so we walked about less than 10 minutes to Grand Central Station for lunch. Before we knew it, we got a text that we were going to be next for the Infinity Room which is 2 hrs earlier than expected. Note that a lot of people cancel. Unfortunately, the link they texted messaged us to check on the queue wasn't working. The museum was very accommodating when we texted our reply that we would be 5 minutes late as we had to rush back to the Broad.\n\nInfinity Mirror Room. You can go solo or win another person. But you don't get to clump your 45 seconds together if there's 2 people. It was pretty and everything I imagined. I had my phone ready before I went in and took quite a few photos. I even had 15 seconds left over. It goes by quick but it's plenty of time.\n\nWas this adventure worth it? Absolutely. I appreciate the arts and the fact that this free to the public is amazing. If you have the time to book in advance it'll make all the difference.\n\nAlso compliments to the staff and how well organized the layout of the museum is handled both inside and out.
