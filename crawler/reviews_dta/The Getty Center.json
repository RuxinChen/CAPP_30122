It is entirely made of marble and sits at the top of the hill that divides the city, and it houses some of the most extraordinary pre 20th century European art in existence. From Van Gogh and Monet , to ancient Roman artifacts and tapestries and everything in between. There are also traveling exhibits that feature more modern work. The art is divided into 4 buildings that can be visited in the order of your preference. There are special family rooms as well as activities for kids to stay entertained and learn about art. The buildings are well-designed, with lots of natural light and high ceilings. The grounds include a labyrinth of gardens and manicured lawns that is a tranquil place to sit and read, write in a journal, let the kids blow off some steam or simply meditate and relax. There are fountains and flowers; babbling brooks and tall cactus plants.\n\nAnother amazing feature of the Getty is the Garden. The beautiful labyrinth-like garden features flowing water and changes with the seasons. If you get hungry you should go to the cafe to sample the amazing daily menu.
