There is a little gift shop there with relatively good prices. At the very top you can see some of the runs of Heavenly and enjoy the Tammarak lodge. The price is kinda high for food and drinks at this lodge, but much what you would expect at a ski resort. The Gondola is free with the usual lift ticket on skiing and $48 without the ticket.

Also the many stairs and ski boots simply don't mix at the end of a very long day on the slopes. I witnessed many slips and falls over the 8 days.

The lines were insanely long and unorganized.

As we got on the skiing side of the mountain, we asked employees of the resort for help, and they were incredibly rude and mean. I fell my first near a slope and this Heavenly employee (operated the lift) told me it was my fault for falling and continued to berate me as I got hit by another skier (and apologized to him). I'm sorry I'm not experienced since this was my first time skiing. Heck, this is the first place I came to see snow. It didn't stop there as several employees were horribly degrading us, as we asked for simple stuff. I remember asking one employee (helping out at the tubing area) if he could take a picture of my family and he yelled and rudely told us off that he was working and he didn't have time to deal with guests.\n\nSeriously, it's like the employees of this resorts hate international guests. It's like they're nice to locals and regulars in one moment, and then when it's people like us, who are new and curious to the place, they shun us and over exaggerate our faults.\n\nThe locals and other guests were so kind to help us (like preventing us from getting lost and simply lending a hand), but the employees are just so discouraging. Don't get me wrong, there are a FEW employees who are kind (these are the instructors), but the employees who are doing minimal work (like standing around the lift, activity places, entrance) are one of the worst customer service I've ever received.\n\nFinally, that experience wasn't worth the price! Everything was expensive. Expect to spend about $500 for 2 people in 1 day. I would've been fine with spending that amount, but most of the employees are ridiciously the worst people.\n\nIf you're a visitor from another place/ country, don't come here.

You need to get off at the first stop so you can take pictures of the lake. The second stop has an adventure park for the kids with a ropes course, tube slide, and zip line. There is an additional charge and waiver that need to be signed but the kids in this area were having a blast. We filled out the extra waiver and got a hand stamp that allowed us to ride an additional chair lift up the next mountain. There were several walking trails. We weren't up for the hikes, but many others were enjoying the trails.\nThere were no lines getting on and off the gondola or chair lift.

We showed up an hour early like we were instructed. We waited in the gondola line and then were told we had to check in in the heavenly store. Would have been nice if that was clearly stated during the booking process or maybe a large sign at the gondola to let people know.\n\nWe waited in another line to check in to sign the waivers. From there we waited in yet another line at the cashier in the store to get our wrist bands and pay.

However, the chairlift ride up the the zipline platform runs parallel with the zipline soooo you get the view up and back down.\n\nThe zipline itself is awkward. You are harnessed like normal ziplining except you sit in a chair apparatus.

Summer options are SO different than winter.\n\nWe did the Blue Streak Zipline (the longest one at 3300 feet) and everyone loved it. We had 3 grown ups who were a bit squeamish to try it, but found it was awesome, and two 12-year olds who loved it but felt like it could have gone even faster. (I think because they were lighter, they may have gone slower than the grownups, who thought it was plenty fast). They tell you it can get up to 50 miles per hour at the highest speed, you slow down significantly below that before coming in to \"land\". You sit in a seat, which makes it feel less frightening than some ziplines. It's a long ride (for a zipline) with lovely views. Really recommend it.\n\nThe kids and some of the adults also did the \"middle\" of three ropes courses. It was was really fun for all, although the adult most afraid of heights was definitely put off by some of the crossing options. It's nice that there are multiple ways to get though the course and you can try different routes. There are three ropes course options -- one for very small kids, a mid-range one that's great for tweens and more conservative adults, and the largest one targeted at adventurous adults.\n\nIt's a little complicated to figure out the ticketing structure for the summer activities. There is no \"one ticket for all activities\" pass. The two longest ziplines must be purchases separately, a set of activities including the ropes courses and a tubing run come as part of a package, and there are two options for a 5 or 7 zipline \"canopy tour\" that is totally separate. I think they could simplify the ticketing a bit. But we got there at 11am and happily stayed till the activities closed at 4pm. Could easily have arrived earlier and spent the entire day there. Fantastic for our 12 year olds and adults. The younger kids options looked like they would be equally as fun.\n\nOne note -- I found the \"dry land\" tubing a little uncomfortable. You basically are tubing on some kind of astroturf. You go remarkably fast, and the sides of the tubing run feel low. I kept thinking I was going to slide over the edge and scrape myself up. I did not...nor did I see anyone else slide out of the track, so it's likely just my fear. But it felt dicey to me.
