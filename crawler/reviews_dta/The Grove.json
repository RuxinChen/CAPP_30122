However, they claim to be dog-friendly, except they have a horrific policy against pit bulls of any kind. I have seen people asked to leave with perfectly well-behaved pit bulls. Meanwhile, people with tiny, yappy dogs are allowed to ignore all dog etiquette and let their dogs roam far away on extendable leashes, run up to unsuspecting people, and bark their heads off. Last time I was at the Grove, a woman has her dog/rodent in Banana Republic. She was letting it roam on its leash and IT BIT ME! Pit bulls (which are usually extremely loyal and gentle) are not allowed but these tiny terrors are?? Rethink your policies, Grove. It's the dog owners who are problematic, not the breed.

Parking is usually abundant except when there is a special event or its a holiday in which case watch out. Looking for a parking space becomes a dog-eat-dog undertaking. What makes the Grove so special I think is the unique approach to the layout. It\u2019s like a small open air neighborhood almost with a movie backlot feel. It\u2019s feels small and cozy and it\u2019s just very pretty to look at. The only caveat (downside) of this mall is that it\u2019s targeting an upscale clientele. Unless you are well heeled financially, this is a sighseeing destination only. You will run into a lot of tourists here.The other reason this is a great destination is that the Farmer\u2019s market is right next door. That alone is worth the visit.

The majority of people I talk to who are from the city or visiting typically complain about this fact when the Grove is brought up.\n\nTraveler Tip: I'd Uber/Lyft if possible to avoid having to find parking OR simply just be patient and not let it affect your overall experience.\n\nOverall: I think there are other places in LA to go depending on what you are looking for. If shopping, head to a mall (there will be a lot more stores to choose from). If restaurants, there are plenty all over LA that have their own parking lots.\n\nI'm a fellow traveler so I appreciate when other people have given me tips/recommendations while in a new city.

I am a fried oysters fanatic and have ordered them at 40 plus restaurants but these fried oysters had me in culinary heaven!!! Besides this kiosk there are many others serving food from almost every culture. But if you want to stick with American fare there were a couple of kiosks serving grilled or baked chicken which my teenage son loved. There was also a fudge place that had rocky road fudge with lots of marshmellows inside which I couldn't pass up.There are lots of outdoor tables here some in the shade and some in the sun. There are also some cool souvenir stores here and a sticker store with every sticker imaginable.

I also found the people to be quite shallow, perhaps more than anywhere else in L.A. The shopping is quite meh. I wasn't impressed at all. It's not a 'landmark to visit' just somewhere to go if you have a few spare hours and want to eat somewhere new. It's also a lot smaller than you might think.
