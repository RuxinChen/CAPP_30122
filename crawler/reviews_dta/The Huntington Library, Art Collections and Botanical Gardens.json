The Japanese and Chinese botanical gardens are absolutely beautiful. All other botanical gardens are also pretty great and the few cafes available serve tasteful and quality food.

We had been given entry tickets ($21 each seniors) and the price of afternoon tea in the rose garden ($35 each) as a present and it was one of the best presents we have received in a long time. The gardens were fabulous, even though it was too early for most things - imagine what it will be like in the summer, there was so much to see and explore. The Japanese garden was our favourite with a remarkable collection of bonsai and sympathetic planting. We could only wiz through the two main galleries and the library as we had so little time but, although they make a big thing of having Gainsborough's Blue Boy, there are a couple of Turners and Constables too.

The citrus gardens were completely off-limits, and while we were told they have a wonderful art collection, we could never figure out which building it was housed in. The gift shop was expensive, but beautiful, with a nice selection, although numerous items had no price tags.

This short review covers only the two Asian (Chinese and Japanese) gardens, which is a subset of all botanical gardens in Huntington Library.\nThere is a gap close to 100 years when the two libraries were built. The Japanese Garden reflects an orderly, simple, serene and tranquil qualities of a typical Asian garden in early 1900. As you compose the photo scenes, there is always a focal element you can easily capture to demonstrate a harmony between men and nature. The Japanese dwelling architecture, internal furnishings and external layout of rocks and greens symbolize a culture at ease with the natural elements on earth.\n\nThe newer Chinese garden, on the other hand, packs a lot of scenic content into a small place. With every twist and turn on your path, there will be lots of subject content to focus on. At times, scene composition can be complex among the willows, lake reflection, bridges, stationary boat, tea house and waterfall rocks.

The gardens are outstanding and full of interest, ranging from the desert garden, with a spectacular collection of unusual cacti and succulents, to the serene, quiet and exquisite Japanese and Chinese gardens with ponds, a Japanese House and ceremonial Tea garden. My wife and I were struck particularly by the Huntington villa, with its grand hall and dual staircase and the drawing and dining rooms. But the highlight is undoubtedly the art on display. Henry Huntington was obviously an Anglophile as the collection includes a number of portraits and landscapes by Thomas Gainsborough - unfortunately, the famous \u201cBlue Boy\u201d had been removed for restoration - Joshua Reynolds, J.M.W. Turner and John Constable, among others. Other European art includes paintings by Watteau, Canaletto and van Dyck, magnificent tapestries, sculptures and collections of wonderful Sevres porcelain ware. We visited two of the permanent exhibits in the library. The \u201cRemarkable Works, Remarkable Times\u201d exhibit contains some extraordinary works, including a beautifully, decorated manuscript of Chaucer\u2019s \u201cCanterbury Tales\u201d (ca 1400-1405), a Gutenberg Bible (ca 1450-1455), a first edition of Shakespeare\u2019s collected plays (1623) and a wonderfully illustrated \u201cBirds of America\u201d by Audubon.

Sadly, the museum was closed. Next time, though.\n\nMake sure you obtain the free map of the Huntington before you start walking around.

The walking paths that meander through and among these various gardens facilitates the walk. However, you will need to take off the beaten path to really get a feel for these other gardens. The Jungle Garden is a great place for some quiet, solitary time...and some shade on a warm or hot day. On the walk back to the main areas, I was enticed by the Desert Garden succulents along the path. They truly are beautiful and some you may never have seen with your own eyes.\n\nI just didn't have time to visit the other gardens which are probably just as nice (i.e. Japanese, Chinese, Australian, etc.). I'll do that next time. On the way back, I spent time in the Store. This is really a great store and you're sure to find something to buy and enjoy representing the gardens or museum.\n\nFinally, I should mention the Children's Garden. This truly is a magical place for both adult and child (but, mostly the child). It's actually constructed for the child in mind, including height and access.

The art collection is limited but the house does give a glimpse of the private rooms of a mansion at the turn of the 20th century. What I find has changed is the number of people who think it is ok to bring their screaming, crying child to a museum and not keep them under control.\n\nI have to admit the sheer volume of middle class helicopter moms has exploded and is now infecting the presentations of culture in our society. Never more than at the Huntington. Gone are well mannered parents who use the opportunity to teach civility and manners to their children. They have turn a public place into their back yard where is is permissible for them to lay the child down anywhere and change their soiled and smelly diaper on the lawn, table, bench or wherever they please. Don't think these parents are capable of finding a garbage can anywhere either. They also allow their children to run loose and unsupervised much like the antivaxer parents on the west side who feel entitled to subject everyone to their out of control children and have tried nothing to keep them under control and are all out of ideas.\n\nOther than these observations the gardens and house were nice way to spend the afternoon.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 23, 2017", 5.0, "Where is that rating of six on Trip Advisor?", "If the Huntington was only its Botanical Gardens it would be one of the top places to visit in the world.

My regret was that I did not visit the Huntington Library and Gardens earlier. This is one of the greatest sites in southern California! I am blessed to have visited the Louvre in Paris and the Hermitage in Russia and can tell you with confidence. The Huntington should be mentioned in this august list of great centers in art, culture and science. I primarily went to see THE Gutenberg Bible. I was unaware of the number of original manuscripts and premiere editions of historical publications were also included in the library. I knew that \"The Blue Boy\" and \"Pinkie\" were exhibited at the Huntington. I was stupefied at the number of great paintings keeping them company. The themed gardens were a stunning surprise, too! There is a clever one dedicated to the children. The eateries and store are worth visiting on their own accord. They are available to the public without the price of admission. The entrance fee per individual is what you probably pay in one week for Starbucks visits. If you live in the area, you should spend the $139 for membership.
