We paid the admission ($32 USD pp) and entered the ship, looking for a restaurant to have breakfast. We eventually found the Promenade restaurant. We ordered from the menu rather than eating at the buffet. The food was really disappointing. I had the chicken and waffles. The over cooked spinach overpowered the flavours, and the waffles were soggy. The chicken was undercooked. My partner ordered the eggs benny. The hollandaise tasted like it was from a package, and the potatoes were brown on the outside and raw on the inside. We brought this to the attention of the waiter who shrugged his shoulders and brought us our check - no discounts applied. We proceeded to the tour area where we were informed that the self-paced audio tour wasn\u2019t available due to the renovations (badly needed), however we were not informed of this when we purchased our tickets from the ticket booth. We toured the Princess Diana exhibit, which I would rate as a 5 out of 10, the proceeded to the 4D theatre for the historical show. The 4D aspect is more annoying than entertaining. They spray water in your face, blow air on your neck and sweep your legs with an air hose. At this point we decided that our limited time in SoCal was too valuable to spend any more time at this pathetic exhibit, we retreated to our car to pay $8 US for parking, after having our ticket validated at the crappy restaurant.

We have always loved the history and had a wonderful experience at our wedding, everyone stayed on the ship, enjoyed the piano bar and in general had a great time. In college we took tours of the ship and loved it. In December 2017 we went to see my mom who still lives in SoCal. We thought it would be enjoyable to take her and my aunt, both in their late 70's, on the tour and have lunch. To begin with the cost of the tickets was very expensive for a tour (a movie was to be included, more on that later), over $100 for the four of us, but we had such a great time in the past and none of us had been there in years so we decided to go ahead. We started with lunch which was good and it was a beautiful day so it was nice to sit and look out at the ocean. On our way to lunch we passed a tour group and the guide was so loud and obnoxious that we all commented that we hoped he would not be our guide (unfortunately he was). Our tour began at 1p and this is where everything deteriorated. The tour guide, although very knowledgable, was more interested in trying to be funny and make it about himself to a point of being obnoxious, so much so that 30 minutes into the tour we couldn't stand listening to him anymore that we left the group. He wasted a lot of time standing around and when he did begin to share some information about the history of the QM his tone and way of storytelling was so distracting that it was hard to listen to him. We were all so incredibly disappointed, we had really looked forward to it and for the money we spent it was definitely a huge let down. Because we left the tour early and didn't have anything else to do, we decided to go watch the movie we had been told about and that, was included in our price, about the QM. After receiving poor directions on how to get to the theater and not having good walkable access, especially for anyone who has trouble walking (both my mom and aunt do) we find out that a Sponge Bob movie was playing and it would be another 2 hours before the historical movie would be played. At this point everyone was so annoyed by our experience that we decided to leave. What was supposed to be a fun filled afternoon left us all very disappointed. Our 20 year wedding anniversary is coming up in 2019 and we had planned to have a reunion with our wedding party and family but are now seriously re-considering it. If the tour was that bad, what is everything else like? I hated to write this because as I stated in the beginning, I have always LOVED the Queen Mary, it holds a special place in my heart which is why this experience was so disappointing but someone needs to pay attention to what is happening on these tours because it is a huge disservice to anyone who does not know the history of the QM or is experiencing it for the first time.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 23, 2018", 4.0, "On Board or On Land?", "Prior to sailing on our Carnival Cruise we chose to stay a night in The Queen Mary Hotel that is located next door to the Carnival Pier.

It is a lot of walking and a lot of stairs, so if you're elderly or have trouble walking and standing for long periods of time, this may not be the tour for you. Wear comfortable shoes! Now, the negatives: this tour is about walking up and down the ship's hallways (which you can do for free) while a guide tells you 4 or 5 stories about ghosts that were spotted in those locations (ex: ghost in white was seen here, moving on, ghost in white was seen here, moving on). You don't get to go inside any haunted rooms or even see the inside of a hotel room - just stand outside the door of both the Eisenhower suite and Churchill suite. Literally - you look at the door. You move from top floor to bottom floor (7 levels) of the ship. While it is labeled a \"paranormal\" walk, the \"paranormal\" activity comes from the tour guide turning off the lights, telling you to take pictures of mirrors, and going home and checking if any ghosts appeared in your photo. She/he proceeds to do this throughout every \"spot.\" Many of the short stories of supposedly seen ghosts don't come with a \"spooky legend\" but just a speculation about who the ghost might have been and how they might have died. As a young adult who is scared of even the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland, this was a boring disappointment. Much of what is shown can be seen for free. You pay for the history of the ship... which can be found online (like who built what and who painted what). Also, much of the history is about older celebrities who once visited the ship and in my early 20s, I did not recognize a single name and therefore was not impressed. Definitely felt like an older, family activity! While the staff here is very kind, this tour is unnecessary and outdated. The ship itself is very old and dilapidated.

Luckily, our tour guide had a loud, booming voice, but it was still a lot of people to manage, especially since we were routed through other events going on and placed into small quarters at times.\n\nWe went through the Titanic exhibit in the dark - literally. Another attendee asked why we were seeing the exhibit in the dark, and the tour guide indicated that he did not know where the lights were. This seems odd, given that the guide has worked on the ship for 11 years. I kept waiting for someone to trip or knock over a display case or something, with so many people in the pitch dark, using their cell phones as flash lights. It was impossible to view any of the exhibit.\n\nWe then spent considerable time in the engine room, where my boyfriend and I did have experiences, although it is obviously difficult to investigate or ghost hunt with 40 people and several other loud events going on nearby.\n\nAfter that, we were walked up to the isolation room, which we were told security had accidentally locked. As a result, we were unable to participate in that portion of the tour. Again, we were disappointed, since that sounded like one of the most interesting rooms.\n\nWe were walked past the most haunted room on the ship - B340 - and again, denied access. We couldn't go in the swimming pool area, which is also normally a part of the tour, because of construction. So basically, we paid over $100 to see one of the haunted locations and hear a few ghost stories by a stairway and in a social event room, and that was it. The total duration of the tour was about 1 1/2 hours.\n\nAfterwards, we watched the Ghost Adventures episode where the Queen Mary was investigated and discovered how much key information about the ship was left out of the tour. On the tour, we were told there were only 56 recorded deaths on board. We were told nothing about the Queen Mary's collision with a companion ship that killed 338 people.\n\nSo, if you're going to visit the Queen Mary, I recommend, instead of taking a tour, doing your own research and then just visiting the boat in general. Be prepared to be gouged for parking or find another place to park nearby and walk over. It was suggested to me by a paranormal investigator friend to rent a hotel room there and do your own investigating - in the middle of the night, when the activity from the events has subsided for the evening.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 29, 2017", 3.0, "Vast Old Lady of the Sea from a Bygone Era", "Booked a space on the Glory Days Tour as part of my admission ticket.

There are plaques up throughout the ship telling history and ghost stories. There is also a room that has models of other ships and a cutaway of the Queen Mary herself.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 6, 2017", 2.0, "A re-visit to the Grand Old Lady after 30 years", "We last came here 30 years ago when it was lovely and really good value for money.

She needs either serious money spending on her to bring her up to scratch and safety - a lot of the decks were rotting, paint peeling, or she needs to go to a watery grave. The last time our entrance ticket allowed us to view the ballrooms and other rooms inside. This time, we only saw a very dingy corridor. The restaurants were totally overpriced, so we didn't eat here. Being a couple of people who love ships, we really wished we hadn't come. Wake up Long Beach, you still could have a very good attraction if only you were prepared to spend some money on this lady to bring her back up to scratch.\nShow less"]]}}
