Driving around here can be stressful, especially near the holidays and summer months so be aware that it may take a long time to go down some of the streets surrounding it. Also during the summer there are many bicyclists and people crossing which also makes it difficult to drive. There are many parking structures with decent parking rates, but during busy times in the summer these can fill up and you might have to park further away. The actual promenade is pretty much just like an outdoor mall on a street. There are a lot of stores that you see a lot in regular malls, but there are more unique stores that are scattered in as well. They usually have late hours, which gives you the freedom to come later in the day. Most of the more popular stores are closer to the Santa Monica mall at the end of the promenade is where the department stores are. Then as you keep going down, the stores get more sparse and there may be empty store fronts. There are a couple of movie theaters with 2 AMC's, an Arclight at the end of the mall, and Laemmie which is one street over from the promenade. The tickets are a little pricier since they are on the promenade or close to it, but it's only usually a few dollars more than usual. Most of the places to eat on the promenade are pretty pricey, but there are a few fast places like bruxie, chipotle, and a pizza place next to the AMC. But most the sit down restaurants will be expensive. There are usually entertainers on the promenade which can be sometimes be fun to watch. Everything is outdoors, which makes it nice and makes you feel like you aren't really in a mall. Overall, you can shop, eat, and a see a movie which is the usual for a mall, but it does have the added value of being outdoor and entertainers as well as most of the stores are pretty good if that's what you are there for. Also, it's easy to visit the pier and beach from the promenade so you wouldn't have to drive again to do those things.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 24, 2018", 4.0, "Great Atmosphere!", "Nice location to spend all day with shopping, outdoor and indoor restaurant !

Look out for the offers."], ["Reviewed September 29, 2017", 4.0, "Another shopping mall", "Yes, it is nice and yes it is clean. The shops here are the same shops you will find in pretty much every shopping centre in the US. The difference? It is an outdoor mall that spans around 4 blocks. It is pleasant to walk and shop and there are a couple of really nice restaurants. I would recommend visiting and shopping at around dinner time. That's when there is real atmosphere here with street performers and some great people-watching.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 28, 2017", 5.0, "Beautiful street with high quality buskers", "This is our 3rd visit to santa monica and the promenade is always a favorite.
