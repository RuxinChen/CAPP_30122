There were still maybe one of two parking spots left, so if you drove I would recommend going about this time or earlier even. The view here is very famous and it is a great way to look into the valley itself. You don't need to allot a lot of time here; we stayed maybe 10 minutes to take our photos and appreciate the view and then left. It is definitely worth seeing though.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed July 6, 2017", 5.0, "Great views", "Definitely coming up on the 4th of July weekend is crazy...the whole park was like a parking lot and was disappointed with the lack of communication with the Park Rangers The park is beautiful"], ["Reviewed July 6, 2017", 5.0, "Only need 5 minutes..GO Early", "Go here first than to Sentinel Dome hike. worth stopping quick for a great view. after 9 am it can be maddening crowded"], ["Reviewed July 5, 2017", 5.0, "Breath taking", "How do you give nature anything less than a 5 star review??

Thanks to all the rainfall in California recently, all the waterfalls are raging and you can see them from the overlook.

It is literally at the end of the tunnel you drive through so slow down in the tunnel and get ready to turn left in to the parking lot as the tunnel ends.

All I could say was \"Wow!\" You look straight into the valley with El Capitan on the left and Half Dome in the distance, and beautiful water falls on the right. So captivating. The parking is well done, with good signage and information, with beauty all around. Because there was a wet winter, many of the roads were closed for repair so going into the valley was a little disappointing. Many detours and waits, never made it to the visitor center because the signage there is not very good with all the detours. Never made it to half dome, etc... so coming into the park with the Tunnel view was the highlight of our trip to Yosemite.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 26, 2017", 5.0, "Great tour, beautiful scenery and wonderful information", "Sights are breathtaking....our tour guide, Marsha with Discovery Yosemite Tour, was incredible.
