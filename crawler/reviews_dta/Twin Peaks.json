This is the place to see it all happen, the high point of San Francisco. The fogs embrace everything with a damp kiss and are wonderful. Up here one afternoon, it started out clear and then silently but swiftly, the fog started rolling in and really, in a matter of 10 minutes, had embraced all once again. Quite an experience. But a great place to takes in the amazing views, however long they are revealed, and to contemplate.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 14, 2017", 4.0, "Good place to have a good view of San Francisco", "Drive up the small hill and you are going to be rewarded by the fabulous view of San Francisco.

Whenever I would get tired of the city and wonder why I moved there and fell in love with it.I would drive to the top of twin peaks and remember why I moved there. San Francisco has to be one of the most beautiful locations for a city anywhere. From twin peaks you can view the entire city as well as the pacific ocean, the golden gate bridge and down past the bay bridge. I especially like visiting when a heavy fog rolls in. There is no other experience I have found but when you find yourself enveloped by the fog drowning out almost every sound around you. I no longer live in San Francisco but I still make the trip to the top of twin peaks for this awesome experience.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 13, 2017", 5.0, "Always a great view", "We visited on a clear and sunny day so the views were amazing!

You can drive right to the top and park although there aren't a lot of spaces so you might struggle if it's busier. You can always park on the street lower down though but would just be a longer walk up. The view is fabulous of the city and great to take photos. Although the view is changeable, and changed with the fog even whilst we were stood there for 15-20 minutes, you can still see plenty.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 12, 2017", 4.0, "Amazing Views", "A must see when vacationing in the San Francisco area.

Wow, what a view! You can see the whole of San Francisco from up here, and on quite a clear morning we were able to do just that. The view is so good, that the fog on the Golden Gate Bridge looked just like cotton-wool on a toy bridge, with the remainder of the whole area bathed in bright sunshine. One imposing item that cannot be missed from up here is the \u2018absolutely huge\u2019 telecommunications antenna that is situated on one of the peaks, looking remarkable like something out of a science-fiction movie; but fortunately, this is towards the rear of the sight-seeing area, so it does not impede your view of the City below. As stated, this area is accessible by Coach, Car & Bicycle, however, you can walk up here, but I would not like to do that unless I was an athlete; it\u2019s a long way up. As far as I could see there were no parking charges and vehicles were coming and going frequently as all there is up here is the view, so when we had done that, it was time to go. It is worth the trip up here for the view, but only if you have the transport, otherwise it would take too long for just a short visit.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 11, 2017", 4.0, "Great view of city", "One can enjoy the great views of city from these peaks.watching sunset or nightlights is grand here."], ["Reviewed September 10, 2017", 5.0, "Breathtaking!", "I can't believe it took me 4 visits to get up here!
