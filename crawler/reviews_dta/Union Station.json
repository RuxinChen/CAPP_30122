I've traveled across Europe, India, and some parts of the middle east, so I really can't give it 5 stars, given that, unfortunately, trains are not the main mode of transportation, especially in LA, it is simply not as impressive as some of the train stations I have crossed in my travels.\n\nHaving said that, the architecture is very nice, it's easily accessible, centrally located, with a good set of routs (this could be improved but I can't fault the station for it, this is more the train providers, but still). The station itself has all the amenities you'd expect with multiple eateries, bus connections, a lounge area, two gardens to hang out in while you wait, and it even has a rental car facility.\n\nAll in all, a good, iconic train station. Certainly above average, what would really make it a true five star (and again, I really can't blame the station for this as much as the train companies) is the lack of routs. Union station could be an awesome waypoint for travel via trains, but as I mentioned above, unfortunately we Americas are way to dependent on our cars.

Even the six-day shoe shine & repair stand, overseen by its maestro Marco, is a throne-like section of leather and brass that makes anyone want to shed their sneakers.\nAnd because this is Los Angeles, Hollywood, after all, there is an endless collection of street characters, including people who look like they were or should be in show business: at Traxx, two men in the usual black on black outfits of the movie trade, are trading pitches over white wine and the hostess is so theatrical she looks ready to faint on cue.
