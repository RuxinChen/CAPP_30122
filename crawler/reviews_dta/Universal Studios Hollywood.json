Our little one was just a tad too short for the rides, and they would not have been appropriate for him anyway. Getting from the Upper area to Lower area with the Stroller was a nightmare. You cannot use the elevator for a stroller, just a wheelchair. You have to fold it up and try to navigate 4 escalators with it.\n\nFor the lot tour, you were allowed to take your stroller on the elevator....but it had a line and would have taken us 30+ minutes to use it. I felt sorry for those in wheelchairs.\n\nWe went on a busy day and the lines were terrible. We couldn't justify another $80 for ticket (on top of the $120 we already paid and the $50 to park) to get \"front of the line\" passes. so we waited. and waited.\n\n50 minute wait at Jurassic Park turned into 70 minutes...for a 2 minute ride. It was cool, but nothing I'd wait more than 20 minutes for.\n\nThe Simpson's ride was fun. The Lot Tour was worth the long, winding queue line.\nMy older son loved the Harry Potter area. The Butter Beer was good.\n\nI enjoyed the Simpson's area.

We did the cheap parking and cheap tickets so we could afford gas to get home (only half kidding) but, the experience was worth it. It was very crowded but we had a blast. The experience was nothing like we had the last time we went here decades ago. Food courts are good (expensive) and all over the place. The rides are good.

It was my son's birthday and when I shared that with Mike, he went and got him a Happy Birthday pin with his name on it.\n\nI had only been expecting a semi private tour of the studio itself, but Mike acted as a private concierge/personal assistant throughout the entire park. He was very engaging and knowledgeable about Universal Studios, it's history and movies. He took the group to every ride and walked us up to the very front of every ride, offering to hold bags, cell phones and any other personal items. He even shared with us the best places to sit on the ride for the type of experience one may desire. (Note that a VIP pass trumps the FastPass and you go immediately to the VERY front of the line and get on the ride).\n\nMike took the group to lunch (included as well) and came back to collect the group once lunch was over. He took us on the Studio Tour and again was extremely knowledgeable about the history of the movies that were filmed by Universal Pictures as well as the sets. With this tour we were able to visit the inside of the actual set of Superstore, and get off the shuttle at various locations throughout the Studio. We also were able to visit the inside of the prop warehouse. Mike was very patient with and kind to all of the children in group, answering all questions that were asked.

From the security guard to a greeter to the VIP experience employees to the VIP tour guide to every single person we interacted with at Universal Studios, they were all amazing at customer service. Two adults were traveling with two teenage girls, and I don't know if this was intentional on the VIP check in employee's part or not, but we were placed in a VIP group with two other families that also had two teenage girls in each family. The six girls quickly became new friends, and our tour was excellent because of the dynamic that we had with similar ages. Tim H. was our VIP guide, and you should request him when you do the VIP tour! He was excellent!! Very attentive to each person's needs, explained each ride before we went on it, and the details and information he gave us throughout the entire trip was so interesting. VIP tickets are great if you want to ride on many rides: while the parents in our group went on the Mummy ride once, the girls ended up going on it six more times in a row together! They did this in less than a hour, as they went to the front of the line each time due to the VIP tickets. For them, the VIP tickets were about how many times they could ride a ride. For the us, it was about the things we learned about movies, the movie / tv making process, not standing in line and fighting for seats at shows, as the VIP tour has reserved seats, and not having to navigate the park map ourselves, and yes, not having to wait in line for rides. Tim was a great guide, and we got to every ride and show during our day! Lunch was surprisingly good as well. Items were labeled vegetarian, but not labeled gluten free. That would be an improvement that they could make. When asked about gluten free items, the server did not know, so those in our group who are gluten free stuck to things that were guaranteed to be gluten free (meat, salad without dressing, seafood, veggies, fruit, etc). The meal was still excellent. Tim had ponchos for us when we rode the Jurassic Park ride, and he had great facts about how they built that ride around a tree that is protected by California that was in the middle of where the ride was going. The Harry Potter land was amazing, and wow, that HP ride is a far cry form the roller coasters we grew up on. Do note that if you are sensitive in any way to motion simulator rides, many of the rides at Universal Studios are just that in some variation. Tim H was great about telling us details of each ride before we went on, so that each person could decide if they were going on it or not.

I'm very pleased to say that they catered for Vegans and GF at both sittings. The park itself is vast, we managed to do all of the rides, and a few extra ones only available with the VIP ticket. If you can stretch the budget, please do the VIP, I am not one to be 'sold' something when I can get it cheaper, but for the difference in price, I would actually do this again, when in CA or FL. Queue jumping with a guide is brilliant, you don't feel bad as you have paid for the privilege. The Harry Potter ride is amazing, I did feel a bit faint, but got over it.

Therefore the only way I would ever go to a theme park is with a VIP ticket. I went on Saturday Feb 17 (Holiday weekend) with another couple and a 8yr old girl. I have done this at LegoLand and now Universal. For $350 per person it was well worth it. I cant imagine paying $100 per person to stand in line for hours and hours all day long.\n\nDespite others suggesting that you should start your tour early I actually like what we did better. Also Despite others I think this is great for young children if you do rides first and tour later like we did. The last thing a little kid wants to do is get to the park and take a tour for 2 hours. But if you go early and ride rides while its less crowded and you can skip every line then use the tour as your nice break and ride rides after its great.\n\nWe arrived at 8:00am for early entry, Valet parking was easy. Walked right in and checked in with VIP desk. Had some tea and coffee, used the bathrooms and then set out at 8:30am for Harry potter land. The park was really empty. The magic wand making attraction is the only thing with no VIP line but at 8:30 its only a 20 minute wait and I think later in the day its hours long. We had no wait for the roller coaster, then no wait for the harry potter ride. Then we rode Simpsons, Despicable me, walked around a bit and headed back to the lounge for some food and to meet the tour at 11:15am.\n\nThe Tour of the backlot was a nice break from rides. It was awesome to be able to see the stuff up close and get out and walk around. At the end the best part was not having to navigate the long lines to get back into the park. The drive you to the lower lot back entrance and you sneak back in right next to Jurasic park ride and jump right on. we then rode Transformers, a roller coaster and then went to our late lunch from 2:30-3:30.\n\nLunch was really good quality, plenty of Gluten free options etc. Its quite and not crowded, nice private bathrooms and a little escape from the Maddness of the park.

The rides were great, with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey one of the best. We, a family of 8 attended Universal on a Tuesday. but at $120.00 a person for a park that was open from 10 am to 5 pm seemed high. Not to mention $13.00 for a glass of beer. Our low point of our visit was at the Special Effects Show. Some of our group is deaf, so we had arranged to sit up front to view the closed captioning of the show.\nHere is where things went very very wrong The area for the closed captioning is up front and to the left of the main stage. While waiting for the show to start, you are showed a Universal promo tape Then previews of upcoming movies, these were not closed captioned, and should have been. Once the main show started, the closed captioning screen was on the floor straight in front of you. This was the first problem, to read the text you have to look straight ahead, but the action is 90 degrees to your left. This set up makes it almost impossible to watch the show and read the text. Then the captioning would stop while clearly there was action and words being spoken on the stage. Then the captioning stopped matching the show. In short the event was not enjoyable at all. The whole set up needs to be reworked. Have an executive from Universal sit in front of the screen wearing ear muffs and see how it works for them, reading and trying to watch the show. The screen should be in the center of the stage so that you can read then move your eyes up a bit to watch the action, the performers should stick to their script so that their actions match the captioning.The other rides should be closed captioned some how so that everyone can enjoy the rides equally. So our time at the park was disappointing and we are rethinking attending again. We have shared our views with the deaf community, so many others will be reconsidering attending Universal Hollywood.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 1 week ago", 4.0, "Awesome medical staff but Beware of ollivanders", "My sister fell in The Walking Dead and got hurt.

When we arrived we headed straight to the Harry Potter section, which was pretty much empty! I\u2019m not a big rides fan but my sister went on both the Forbidden Journey and Flight of the Hippogriff. The Hippogriff ride lasts 30 seconds if that and my sister\u2019s view was that she wouldn\u2019t have queued for longer than 5 minutes for it.

At one point the Forbidden Journey ride wait was three hours!\n\nAnother reason why I\u2019m not giving more stars is because of its Animal Actors show. We are animal-lovers and it made us feel very, very uncomfortable seeing some of the animals which were brought out in front of a loud audience. A raccoon, pig, owls and an arctic fox were brought out for \u201ccameo\u201d roles and it felt very pointless to me to put animals through the stress of going on stage for two seconds. Universal Studios may respond to this by saying the animals are used to this, but I don\u2019t feel it is right to have wild animals on show like this. Especially the arctic fox! At the end loads of people were going up to pet the arctic fox and it looked a bit stressed out.\n\nAlso at one point a parrot was made to fly towards a very strong fan to recreate a \u201cflying\u201d scene and it looked really obvious that the parrot was struggling.\n\nSorry to say that the Animal Actors show didn\u2019t fill me with joy.

The Harry Potter Forbidden Journey ride in 3-D was exciting even though you didn't take an actual roller coaster ride (there were no free fall moments or great centrifugal turns), but you thought there was. You went on a ride that travelled within a relatively small area but the visuals and seat rocking up down and sideways made you thing you were truly on that journey with the effects playing tricks with your mind. Because we entered early there was no line to get in which I'm told could be as much as one hour wait (we went twice). The entrance walk to even get to the ride took us about 5 minutes. The Flight of the Hippogriff roller coast ride had no fall (which I'm thankful for) but some exciting turns and only took less than a minute. Definitely go into Ollivanders for a wand show. The other rides in the upper lot were all mind bending in 3-D using the same effect to achieve your participation within the experience. Even the shows were first rate.

The previous attraction based on the films had you watching dancing Volkswagens on the end of robotic arms and just when you think it can't get worse than that. The thing is that it's just a poor copy of the excellent King Kong attraction you saw moments earlier so the thrill is gone.\n\nThe theme park part of the visit is generally good although the \"background\" music they play everywhere is far too loud. The Mummy coaster is fun but far too short, especially compared to the Florida version. It also has an ending that makes absolutely no sense at all especially now that it has been changed from the original.\n\nThe Transformers ride is absolutely amazing and represents the current state of the art in theme park attractions. The fact that you actually at one point travel up to the second floor on an elevator and don't realize it is one example of how good this ride is.\n\nOh, and despite what you thought of the movie, don't miss the live Waterworld show. Easily the best theme park show around but get there early to get a good seat. I recommend the centre section if you can up high so you can see everything. You WILL get wet (for one reason or another) if you sit in the first few rows anywhere so be warned.\n\nThe Harry Potter land is also really good and the ride is fantastic and this is one ride where you will actually want to wait in line so you can see everything in the detailed queu. Even if you go there as a single rider, do the standby line first since the single riders skips most of things to see.\n\nYou must try the butter beer as well though I have to admit that charging $6.00 for what costs them pennies to make is a bit much. Kudos though for the attention to detail everywhere in Hogsmead. You really do feel like you're visiting a small British Village with small crampt stores and what not.\n\nThe other thing I find really annoying is the hawking of their food deal everywhere. Sure, not a bad price but doesn't cover drinks, the one thing they make a ton of money on so I suppose it makes sense. My advice? Bring a water bottle and refill throughout the day.\n\nFinally, they offer a VIP experience where you can see more on the backlot and some other perks like front of the line passes. Unless you go in the middle of the tourist season, you won't need the front of line pass and instead of paying more to see things there, go on the nearby Warner Brothers Studio Tour instead. It's a fantastic tour of a real working studio.\n\nSo ultimately,\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 2 weeks ago", 5.0, "Amazing place!", "I was skeptical of the prices to go but after two days was very impressed with the quality and variety of the rides, the good service and great job they have done with Harry Potter.
