It turns out that this winery often offers barbecue cookouts on the weekends and draws a big crowd.\n\nWe walked the grounds for a bit and shopped their store which, I believe, may be the only winery that also has a deli which sells fine cheeses, meats, salads and sandwiches.\n\nWe chose a wonderful woman to be our wine guide and walk us each through a tasting of five different wines. We enjoyed all that we sampled; Carsi Chardonnay, Dancing Egg Riesling, Los Carneras Pinot Noir, Ancient Vine Crow Ridge Zinfandel, Napa Valley Merlot and GSM Entanglement. We were so impressed with her choices for us that we not only purchased two bottles of wine, but also decided to join their wine club. You only live once, right? And by joining their wine club, they waived the $30.00 cost of the tasting.\n\nHaving our chosen wine for lunch, we strolled outside and ordered two Tri-Tip sandwiches and broccoli salad from the barbecue station within their large, shaded picnic area where over 100 people had congregated enjoying both wine and food. We opened our bottle of Los Carneras Pinot Noir and enjoyed our sandwiches which proved so large we were both unable to finish them.\n\nIt was so relaxing sitting at a picnic table and enjoying our food and wine surrounded by so many others with the same passion for both the wine and the food.

They don't have all the food to choose from that V. Sattui has to offer, but the castle and grounds will blow you away. And don't expect to have the same wines to sample here as Dario produces only Italian varietals at the castle while V. Sattui produces wines more in the Napa Valley tradition of wine making.

I would definitely describe the ceremony area as intimate. The pictures online make it look bigger than it actually is. After the ceremony we were herded into a \"T\" shaped area for appetizers and drinks. It was really cramped. The catering staff that was dressed in all black were nice. But there was a lady working the event that was dressed in lighter clothing that was very condescending which made me uncomfortable and made me feel unwelcomed as a quest. You could tell that the other staff were uncomfortable around her as well. It was weird. My husband and I also had a strange experience in the tasting room before the wedding. We were told by the staff in the tasting room that we could purchase a bottle of wine and drink it outside while we were waiting for the wedding to start. So we purchased a bottle. Then we tried to leave the tasting room. The door was now blocked by a stack of metal grocery baskets. I asked two different staff members in the tasting room how to exit the room since the door was now blocked. One told me to move the the baskets and the other told me that someone would move them for me. The stack of metal baskets was about chest high on me and the door was now latched shut at this point. I didn't know what to do. We finally found a door to exit with our bottle of wine and two glasses. Things only became further confusing after that. Now that we finally escaped the tasting room, we headed for some picnic benches to have our wine before the wedding. There was a security guard waiting at the entrance and we asked her if it was okay that we sat and had some wine. She said yes, no problem. We said thank you and proceeded on. Another thirty feet beyond that there was a group of staff members congregating and some lady asked us if we were going to the wedding. We said yes and then she took our glasses and told us that we could not drink the wine that we had purchased. I had my husband put the wine in the car were it sat for the next four hours because I wasn't going to carry a bottle around with me during the wedding. We never would have purchased a cold bottle of wine if we going to have to put it in the car where it was going to sit and come up in temperature. And those bottles aren't cheap.

We took the first tour in a Saturday morning with a 90+ degree weather. It wasn't pack with people yet at 11:06 am when we arrived, no crowds yet in the picnic grounds but can see them preparing already for the BBQ.Parking was easy at this time of the day. The drive from San Jose to Napa valley took us 2 hours ( left at 9 am), hit some traffic at Oakland but the biggest traffic was when we entered the main road headed to St. Helena were most of the wineries were located, it was bumper to bumper.

We were like 6-7 min late for the tour.I called 3x to the number enlisted at the reservation email to notify we were late due to traffic, but no one was picking up the phone instead a VM was the only option. Left 2 VM. I got No return call but at 11 am,our tour guide called and asked our whereabouts with no idea that I tried calling. Anyway,he handled it very well and very cordial.We made it almost on time because the group didn't yet start.There were 3 couples in our group( there was a large group who came late and missed the tour to the vineyard).I had some winery tours in the past but not in Napa Valley. The tour would talk about the wineries production of wine,the history of the winery, a quick education regarding wines and the Napa region. We walked through the other tasting rooms towards the back of the winery where the vineyards are. The walking tour does not allow you to walk far and will just show how the grapes are formed etc.Take a lot of pictures since you won't be allowed back outside once the tour is over. The tour guide didn't mentioned that nor offered a few minutes if the group wants to take a couple of pictures since the area was one of the picturesque area in the winery. The best area to have your wine tasting, in my opinion, is Tasting in the Terrace ( 1st came 1st serve basis) since you can sit down , relax and have the actual view of the vineyard and the the fountain and can take pictures /sip wine of an actual \"winery\"feel.The best part of the tour is the complimentary tasting in the cellar. We had 3 wines to taste in the actual menu and then had +2 other complimentary wine because one in the group is celebrating his birthday and 1 complimentary from the winery total of 5.

Sattui has some decent wines but nothing to write home about. If your looking for a great place to get a salad or sandwich and some wine to picnic with on their grounds then you should definitely stop in! They do have a killer deli! They have lots of wine themed knick knacks too. This year they were just too crowded to be worth it.

This place is the opposite. Lots and lots of people visiting. The tasting area is loud because of the crowds. However, their wine is very good. Lots of variety including dessert wines. I fell in love with the Madeira- not for everyone, but you should try it!\n\nThey have a big picnic area and sell food. Great place to have lunch and some wine. Many things to buy in addition to wine. Very \"touristy\" but we still had fun.\n\nDon't let the crowds scare you away, give it a try.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed April 9, 2017", 5.0, "A Great Story", "5 of us visited on a rainy Friday afternoon -- a perfect day to taste some of the best wines in the region and renew the bond between family & friends. V. has 3 wine-tasting rooms and the smaller ones are for serious wine enthusiasts who want to taste the reserve & higher quality (& pricier) wines. I prefer the larger noisier main room because the atmosphere is boisterous, its in the gift shop where you can buy cheeses, olive oil, local jams & chutney, crackers & bread, etc., and also because I'm not that serious about wines. The grounds are extensive & beautiful, and the buildings are like medieval castles.

We moved to the left to the next station. That server didn't greet us either. After a few more minutes he came back and said he needed to finish with another customer. He then left, after 5 more minutes of standing and waiting we left. This was not a busy day and appeared there was plenty of help.

I always make it a point to go here when I go to Napa. A great place to go on a picnic. Food is good and the wine is just heaven. There is one cheese that I fell in love with. It's called Havarti. We don't have it in the Philippines so I've been craving for it.\n\nBest to go to on weekday to avoid too much people. Weekends can get really crowded. Although they have BBQ on weekends so it's your choice. But if you want to relax and avoid the chaos then weekdays are better.\n\nThere are picnic tables available outside but you can also bring your own picnic blanket if you want to sit on the grass.\n\nI did not go on the tour but I'm sure that would be an experience too but I was happy to go to their store. Do some wine tasting and go on a picnic outside. You can also see the wine train passing by.\n\nHighly recommended.

This winery is great. Picnic tables where you can eat lunch and drink wine. They also have a deli where you can buy bread, different kinds of cheeses and sandwiches. you can buy a bottle of wine and they will open it and let you borrow glasses if you wish to have a picnic outside.\n\nAbout the wine: I feel like this place is perfect for sweet wine lovers. They have a lot of good sweet wines. from moscato to california madeira (my personal favorite). I was a bit disappointed with their red wines. I prefer red vs sweet and I didn't really find anything think that caught my tastebuds.\n\nThe tasting is pretty reasonable at $15 per person. For 2 for 1 specials (check yelp). Customer service is always good and friendly. This place does get crowded during lunch time so I suggest to visit early or avoid weekends.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed March 12, 2017", 5.0, "Excellent place for lunch with a bottle of wine!", "My husband and I came here yesterday for wine tastings and a picnic lunch.

So great that it's one of the few places we bought from. The guides were friendly and helpful and were awesome at keeping things lively. Do you have a series always busy and lightly and the courtyard is a great place to hang out when the weather cooperates. This location is one of the few places you can eat and drink at the same time due to its age and being grandfathered in from these regulations.\nThis was only one of three places that we \"repeated\" for my last trip. I think we're gonna keep it on every trip that we come here for. Definitely one ofthe best for consistency and wines and variety of wines.\nShow less"]]}}
