It's fair to say that we spent a good amount of time here taking long walks, sometimes even up to Santa Monica.\n\nIf you are visiting LA for the first time and love beaches, you have to come visit Venice and nearby Santa Monica. SM has more of a family friendly vibe with a smaller side of grit, Venice Beach is the reverse. Venice is an interesting cultural experience and I haven't been to any other place like it. Both cities still have some of that quintessential California surf vibe to them.\n\nYou will find homeless people camped out on the sides of the boardwalk and $3 million+ homes nearby. I recently read an article about how Venice is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in LA. The controversial Venice Stakeholders Association would love to change Venice and \"clean\" it up. Tech multi-millionaires (ahem, Google employees) are also changing the dynamic of this neighborhood and driving up real estate prices. Venice is part of what LA likes to call \"Silicon Beach\" which is their attempt to emulate Silicon Valley.\n\nOne of the best parts of coming to Venice is the people watching. You will see so many characters here. There are legends like Harry Perry (in his turban) who has been skating the boardwalk and rocking out on his guitar since the 1970's. It's always entertaining to stop by Muscle Beach and see what's cracking.\n\nBe sure to check out the skate park, it's not far from the Venice \"V.\" It's fun to watch the skaters in the park perform stunts with the ocean as a backdrop.\n\nThere is shopping here, but a lot of touristy and junky shops. As you walk down the boardwalk you will see tables set up with vendors, this was a great place to pick up a piece of wall art. The shops on the other side sell a lot of t-shirts and other touristy goods. It is fun to read the offensive captions on the t-shirts and booty shorts.\n\nIf you like to bike, you could rent one and hit the nearby bike path, it provides a lengthy ride by the beach. Please don't ride your bike in the area with the shops, there is a separate area for you closer to the ocean for biking!\n\nI recommend staying for the sunsets if you can, they are amazing, but it might be a good time to cut out right after that. You do need to keep your wits about you on the Venice Boardwalk. It's probably not the best place to be after dark. There have been issues with homeless people attacking people on the boardwalk. I remember the story of one woman swinging a vacuum cleaner at tourists.\n\nThere aren't many great places to eat on the boardwalk, but you can wander over to nearby Abbott Kinney for hipster eateries galore.\n\nYou can access the start of the Venice Boardwalk from Santa Monica, it's about a 2-2.5 mile walk. Parking is tricky in Venice. If you don't mind a small walk, I would recommend parking by Mother's Beach in adjacent Marina del Rey.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 12, 2017", 4.0, "Easy walking along back of beach", "We enjoyed several long strolls along the boardwalk which runs along the back of the beach.
