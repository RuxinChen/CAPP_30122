The best part of Venice Beach other than the \"people watching\" are the activities you can do there such as biking, roller blading, skate boarding (they have a skate board park), basketball, volleyball, handball & weight lifting. We saw numerous street entertainers who perform for tips and they like to drag out the performance to draw more of a crowd and pull out \"volunteers\" to be part of the show. Don't be surprised if you see some type of film crew taping some kind of show. Don't forget to get a picture of the iconic \"Venice\" sign that hangs over the street. It hangs at the intersection of Windward Ave & Pacific.\n\nIf you visit it appeared that the crowd kept getting larger as the day went along (we left around 5pm) so I don't know how crowded it is at night.
