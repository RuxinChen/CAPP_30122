Once in Winter and once this past Fall.\n\nIt was definitely more frequented in my last trip than the first time I hiked to it.\n\nLets start with my first time hiking to Vernal falls. The first time we trekked to the falls it was Winter or the end of December . We couldn't hike through the shortcut/ steps leading to the fall as it was chained off, for possible icy conditions. So we took the John Muir trail. It consisted of many switchback and keep in mind you are constantly gaining elevation. So after an hourand a half to two hours I believe we made it to where we could spot Nevada from a distance and had to walk down to see Vernal at the bottom. There were not many people on the trail . It was very peaceful. And a very pleasant experience overall.\n\nI tried hiking it in the middle of winter a year after my first vist, but that was an epic fail since the trail was super icy and I didn't have any proper footwear.So we aborted the mission.\n\nLast year we decided to hike to Vernal again, this time there were many people present. Too much for my liking. It was hot. The good thing was that mist trail was indeed open. Don't underestimate those steps. Even though its a shortcut to Vernal you will definitely break a sweat lol. The falls were beautiful , there was a rainbow present and it was awesome sitting and getting some shade after the exhausting steps.\n\nYou definitely get different experiences in different seasons. But winter time is by far my favorite time to visit Yosemite. It is a winter wonderland. I wouldnt bother visiting in summer, too many people and horrid traffic. Can't stand that so I go in the slower months. :)\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 14, 2018", 5.0, "Best waterfall hike in the USA", "The best waterfall hike in the USA.

The hike itself is not extremely long but even then challenging. In the beginning it is quite steep and it is going uphill and downhill. There is a fantastic view on the wooden bridge to Vernal Fall. Near the bridge are also a water refill station and a restroom.\nOn the second part of the trail there are many steps to climb. The steps are uneven, sometimes quite high and there handrails if necessary. It can also be misty and that makes the trail slippery. There were a lot of people going up and coming down. Give the hikers who walk downhill the way. The view to Vernal Fall is on the whole trail wonderful and there are also squirrels to see. It was a great feeling to see the Vernal Fall and we had the luck to see it with an awesome rainbow. The end of September the water level was still quite high. On the top are nice spots for lunch break.\nMost guys walk back the same way and use the narrow steps. We have chosen the john muir trail back to the Yosemite Valley. It is a bit longer but easier to walk and better for the knees. The whole hike is about 4 hours and it definitely a nice one.

However, thousands of people, with babies on their backs, toddlers in tow, and kids running wild, hike it every year. I have acrophobia (fear of heights) so I usually take the John Muir trail further south to go to the top of the falls. However, due to a mixup with my companion, I had to take the Mist Trail during one of the heaviest flows over Vernal falls recorded in the last fifty years. It meant that the upper steps were virtually mini-waterfalls and slippery. However, I made it by not looking down and by using my hiking stick. If you have small kids and the water flow is heavy, I do not suggest hiking the Mist trail with children--take the John Muir Trail to the top. It's not as pretty, you don't follow the Merced River, but you get to the top in one piece. The trailhead to Vernal Falls starts out on the road at the Happy Valley tram stop. There is a bathroom with flush toilets at the trailhead, another one at the bottom of Vernal Falls (along with a drinking fountain, bottle filling station.) If you decide to continue up to the top of the Mist Trail, next to Nevada Falls, there is another bathroom. The trail to Vernal Falls is a consistent climb although not overwhelming and it's paved for strollers, wheelchairs, etc. The views down to the Merced and of Illouette Falls are lovely, especially in May and early June when the water is flowing at its highest rate. You can stop at the bridge below Vernal Falls, near the restrooms and drinking fountain, or start the climb on the Mist Trail and go up to a viewing platform at the top of the falls. Now, here's the most important part of this review. DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, GO INTO THE RIVER AT THE TOP OF THE FALLS. I have been in Yosemite twice when tourist have gone in, thinking the water was tame, only to be pulled by the undercurrent to their death. In 2011 I was there a week before the church tragedy where three people, each trying to save the other, went over the falls. People think Emerald Pool, which is another half mile up the river, is pretty and you can swim it, but DON'T... it's not worth the risk. However, do enjoy the great views and when you're done, don't tell anyone about the hike--it 's already too crowded!

Mid way up we were rewarded with a view of the falls and a rainbow going across it! The latter part is a more strenuous climb, up a steep and narrow path but if you've plenty of water and take your time it is doable (my youngest was 10). At the footbridge there is a water refilling point. We had a great sense of achievement on reaching the top! In summer as this is one of the few waterfalls still running this is a busy spot but this didn't stop me enjoying this walk.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 23, 2016", 3.0, "Busy trail", "This trail is SUPER busy.

Had read it was moderate to strenuous. We are not very fit but took it slowly - kids aged 11 & 9. We started out at 7am as up early with UK time diff and parked in trail head car park as early. It was a long uphill climb but we stopped regularly to take in the views and it wasn't busy. My son started moaning on the steep stairs but we pushed on and made it up to the top. All very pleased to have done it. Great views even in summer. Waterfall not huge in late August but still impressive. Go early to avoid crowds and walk in shade. We came back same way but it is steep on steps. Recommend if up for it even if not an athlete! It is steep and you will be puffing at times. Not recommended if medical issues or under about 7 as there are big drops and steep steps. It was very dry when we went so not slippery.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 20, 2016", 4.0, "Crowded in August", "Since the Yosemite Falls are dried up, this is one of two spots you are going to see running water. It's crowded and hot in the middle to later afternoon. I would suggest going as early as possible to take advantage of the cool and fewer crowds.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 18, 2016", 5.0, "Stunningly Beautiful and Very Crowded", "Vernal Falls is near the bottom of Yosemite Valley, it's about 2 miles from Half Dome Village and it's a gradual incline most of the way if you are coming from the valley. The paths are very well maintained, there are rest rooms and running water to fill your water bottle at the bottom of the falls area. A free shuttle will get you to Happy Isles bridge area and then it's about a mile up to the Falls. This is a beautiful area, it's also not a permit restricted area so to say it looks like Disney at mid-day would be accurate since it is packed with people. There are very steep granite steps, the terrain deserves at least sneakers. It would be very slippery when wet. Not everyone out there is respectful of nature, warning signs or other people so I would prefer to do this area of the trails very early in the morning when it is much quieter and much less crowded. Well worth seeing, just go early and then go elsewhere.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 17, 2016", 5.0, "Great place!", "Vernal falls is not really easy to reach, that's why it's mentioned in \"strenuous routes\". The Misty Trail is very steep, rocks are uneven, trail boots is a must! Be sure to head there with some hours of daylight ahead, as you don't want to descend this super-steep trail in the darkness. Also I wouldn't advise to go there with small children. Age 12 is ok.\nThe view is incredible!

There is one more stop before the top where you can take great pictures of the falls and the inevitable rainbows that it creates. At this point, it is steps all the way and quite narrow.\n\nThe last part is aided by railings and you should push on for the jewell at the top; the view of the falls and the cold water which you can swim in (we went in Aug when the water level is low and the flow is slow (non existent) - DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SWIM DURING HIGH FLOW LEVELS OF THE RIVER.\n\nThe walk down is a lot quicker but can be a little hard on the joints.\n\nOverall stats are: under 2 miles to the top of Vernal Falls and approx 400ft elevation climb. Took slightly under 4 hours pushing the kids hard up the walk in 80 degree heat.\n\nAlthough it was tough for them, my 6 and 9 year old managed the whole climb with numerous stops. They even got nods of acknowledgement and praise from a lot of the adult walkers who were struggling.\n\nAn outstanding walk in an outstanding area. Be aware that the walk from the bridge is stepped and covered in sand - it can be VERY slippy underfoot.\nShow less"]]}}
