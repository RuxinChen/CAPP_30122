We were in town for one night only. We were happy to learn that we would have the opportunity to attend VillageFest. We took the town trolley here from our hotel. The nice driver dropped us off in the thick of the event. it was a beautiful April evening. The street was hopping with music and sights, all framed by the gorgeous palms.\nWe are from the east coast, so there were some foods and items for sale that we were not familiar with. We were eager to explore the types of things available, and met some really nice people who were very proud of their offerings. We passed a cart called something like \"Minus 30\" They were making some type of sorbet on a frozen surface. It was a warm evening, and we had saved some room after our dinner for a treat. I stopped for about 5 seconds to observe and determine what this was. A young woman with extremely garish make-up asked me for my order and I replied that I needed to see what the finished product looked like before I would be ready to order. She then announced loudly that \"anyone who was watching needed to move along to make room for the paying customers\". Now mind you there were very few people near the cart and no paying customers. I was blocking no one. Shocked and insulted, we moved along, right to Ben and Jerrys when I would have preferred to patronize a local vendor. Aside from this unfortunate encounter, we liked the VillageFest.\nIt had a nice variety of gifts, wares, street food, and fresh produce, baked goods, and jerkies.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 6, 2017", 4.0, "VillageFest - Thursday evenings!", "They block off part of Palm Canyon for this street fair.
