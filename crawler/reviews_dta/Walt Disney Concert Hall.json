Parking was pretty cheap ($9) and easily accessible since you find yourself right inside the building itself. The lobby is very labyrinthine and maze-like which leads you into the main theater which is truly breathtaking! The arrangement of the seats is like a compromise between traditional concert halls with most of the seats being in front of the orchestra and the vineyard style where the seats are terraced and surround the orchestra (similar to Berliner Philharmonie). I've heard much about the acoustics and after seeing shows from both the very back and right in front of the orchestra I can confirm that they are fantastic, every note sounds crisp and polished and I can hear every cough, paper ruffling, thud, and clearing of throat throughout the room (not that I wanted to hear those last four, but that's beside the point). Gustavo Dudamel is an amazing conductor and the entire orchestra was unbelievable.

It is the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and plays host to a variety of musical performances from classical, jazz, and world musics. Artists include everyone from Bj\u00f6rk to Bramwell Tovey. Frank Gehry's architecture features attention-grabbing curving and swirling metal and cool white stone on the outside, juxtaposed with colorful carpets and warm woods on the inside. There is a staircase on the north side of the building that leads to a sculpture garden that has a fine view of Bunker Hill, yet feels cozy and tucked away from the din of downtown.\n\nThe WDCH offers free hour-long tours during most days, including guided tours for concert goers ahead of select performances. You can also take a self-guided tour with audio narration by actor John Lithgow.\n\nThe auditorium is an acoustic marvel. Sound carries to every corner without echoes. The pipe organ in the center of the room draws your eye to it with its seemingly haphazard array of pipes (unless you are seated in the rear orchestra section, in which case, you should take some time before the show to admire the organ from a vantage point on the other side of the room). Though ticket sales warn of partially obstructed views, I have sat in these partial view sections, and did not find any obstructions. The auditorium itself is remarkably small (capacity holds 2265 people).\n\nThe Los Angeles Philharmonic takes care to provide an excellent concert experience, so they take such things as audience punctuality and conduct very seriously. The lights in the lobby will flicker 5 minutes ahead of performance time. If you do not take your seat, the usher will not allow you to enter the auditorium until there is a suitable break in the performance. Photography is STRICTLY PROHIBITED during performances, though you are welcome to take pictures before and after the show. A friendly voice will remind you to silence your electronic devices. If you do not heed this warning and your mobile phone goes off, the usher will send you out if your fellow audience members haven't killed you first.\n\nWhile this is a fairly casual theatre compared to some concert halls, call me a snob, but I think it would behoove patrons to familiarize themselves with proper symphony etiquette ahead of time. It's not a black tie sort of place, but dress neatly and appropriately. Applaud the concertmaster and the conductor. Don't applaud between movements of a musical piece.

Frank Gehry's conception is truly remarkable and one gets a full appreciation by walking around the place. There is a garden and amphitheater in back as well as superb scenic views of downtown LA.\n\nThe second experience would be to take in a concert. The LA Phil is one of the country's great orchestras and the sound within the auditorium is outstanding. We've sat in orchestra, orchestra east and terrace west seats and the sound is good in each section. However, the terrace sections are a bit narrow and my wife experienced a bit of vertigo getting to our row 1 seats. The viewing angle is a bit weird (high and to the side) but it can be advantageous for piano concerts. Terrace is quite reasonably priced for what you get.\n\nWe prefer Orchestra East or West seats. We're close to the orchestra and having a view angle that is arguably better than orchestra (which is, of course, an excellent section).\n\nAlso visit the gift shop, particularly if you're a musician or play a musical instrument. A very nice and different selection of merchandise from other gift shops.\n\nAnd for a special experience, have pre-concert dinner at Patina restaurant.
