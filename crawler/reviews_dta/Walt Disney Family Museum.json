The museum is actually over 3 miles away! So we took an Uber.\n\nI thought it was little expensive at $25/ticket. Would probably not do it again.

Be sure to allow plenty of time to savor the different galleries.\n\nOur visit took place during a special exhibition featuring the work of renown artist Eyvind Earle, famous for the paintings in Sleeping Beauty.

I wouldn't really recommend this for kids, as it is very info heavy. As a Disney-phile, I loved this place. Situated in a pretty building off a quiet green square, this is a perfect place to spend a couple of hours browsing through - learning more about the man behind the modern-day behemoth, and seeing actual pieces of your childhood behind glass (animation cells, sketchbooks, paints, models, original merchandise, family photos, etc.) There are various interactive sections of the museum, but probably not enough to keep young children occupied while you're trying to read through the info.

Just learning about Walt's history and legacy was quite interesting. Did you know Walt had a Doctorate Degree? Or that Walt essentially put Technicolor on the map? Neither did I until visiting this museum. All of the awards he received during his lifetime, and the creation of the parks.\n\nYou'll also learn about how he use to work on a farm, all the hardships his family endured and came out on top, good values that most take for granted, it was a very educational and took you down memory lane from early years up to the present.\n\nThere are items from Oscars, to medals, to actually internal memos, to the jeep he drove in the war, etc. There are live recordings of him, you'll even get an opportunity to operate one of the animatronics as the puppeteers did, its just simply too much to list in this review you'd be reading forever.\n\nTickets in my opinion were a bit high, if you are a student definitely ask for student discount adult tickets are $25 per person. Parking is free which is nice as if you are in the San Francisco area there is no free parking anywhere.\n\nYou are allowed to take as many photos as you like, so long as the flash is OFF as in NO FLASH, its amazing how many people don't understand that, especially with camera phones, a flash is a flash; I digress; as in true Disney fashion all rides must end at the gift shop, so does this tour whether guided or self-guided you'll end at the gift shop. Speaking of said gift shop; it was very pricey and surprisingly there were not a lot of specialty pins and magnets as you would find at any of the parks. I really couldn't justify paying $25 and then spending another $40 on a pin and a magnet. They have a small cafe inside on the bottom level\n\nIf in the area, its worth checking out if you have the time, but again it can get pricey if going with a large group. Looks are deceiving when you approach the building looks large, but in reality the museum is not also making it hard to justify the entrance fee.\n\nIf you're a die hard Disney fan, you'll learn the reasoning behind one of Walt's sayings \"Let's us not forget, that it all started with a mouse\".\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 22, 2018", 4.0, "Good History Of Walt Disney", "Very enjoyable trip to the Presidio to visit this museum.

I would recommend reserving at least this much time for the exploration, perhaps taking a break in the cafe. While we were there an exhibition of art by Eyvind Earle (a Disney artist) was also available in a separate Disney Museum building--beautifully displayed and completely enchanting.\nI would note that the museum does not spend any space hyping the current operations of the Disney empire, and it covers only the years of Walt's life from 1901-1966. Hence recent events with Disney co. are not presented, but that allows focus on how the whole evolution of Disney's work occurred.

There are a lot, which just goes to indicate how great Disney and his company were, and I guess still are for the most part.\n\nThe museum follows the chronological events in Disney's life, starting with the early family portraits and pictures of the very young Walt, and ending in his passing in 1966. In between, there is a great deal of content regarding everything: the first animations, creation of Mickey Mouse, the fantastic Fantasia, Disneyland, and the unrealized projects get very detailed treatments. We especially enjoyed the stories about creation of the iconic Mickey Mouse character. After visiting the museum, we watched some of the complete black and white Mickey cartoons, and were again overly impressed with how much fun and entertainment is packed into these pieces, made in the 1930's, without any of the gruesome violence and darkness that prevails in today's children's animated fare.\n\nThere are also a number of projects described that did not come to fruition. One of these, I learned, was the Mineral King ski resort, planned in a remote alpine valley south of Sequoia National Park. Disney passed away during the early planning stages for the project, and the entire undertaking fizzled after his death. The area looked like a great spot for a remote, car-free resort, in the style of some famous ski villages in the Alps. One can only speculate about it though, since we'll never know if Disney's marketing prowess, charm, and tenacity would have been enough to take Mineral King to completion...\n\nThe museum is not large, but is very high quality and with enough things to see, explore, and imagine that a thorough visit could take a half day or more.

That was such a blessing and I know Walt is smiling as he saw my face. We spent over two hours here, lets get started with this review.\n\nWalking in, you start with the Disney family history. The family had their hard times and when Walt Disney first came to Marceline Missouri by train, his eyes were opened to an Idyllic lifestyle. He always hung onto the images of Marceline Missouri and built that into his Main St USA theme parks. Walt felt family was very important and that's how Disneyland was first started. He wanted a place where a father can take his kids on the weekend, to kick back and let loose.\n\nThe museum is really an American treasure. It shows the history and progression of film and how art was integrated into the medium. Walt was a pioneer in this field. He invented special cameras and technologies, won awards and kept on pressing on during and after WWII.\n\nHere's a story, it's a glimpse of the mans generosity. Walt knew his artists needed to be cutting edge. He goes to a few local art schools and was laughed at except one. He spun it, train my artists. Once my movie is finished, I will pay you in full. True to his word, the movie was finished and Walt paid the final bill. Years later, the proprietor was sick and her home & the school was about to being foreclosed. Walt heard this news, paid off all her debts, set up healthcare for her and a trust to be used until her passing. Folks, that is on a level of sainthood.\n\nSeeing all the wonderful technologies and accomplishments until his passing, Walt Disney was a great American. This museum is a testament to the mans life.

On Saturday we chose to go visit the Walt Disney Family Museum at the Presidio. Our choice was based on the fact that we had never been there before, and the current exhibit features the work of Eyvind Earle, an artist that my brother and sister in law love (and collect). I did not have great expectations, as our artistic choices differ, but looked forward to a day of sharing time. This became a great day. First off, Eyvind Earle did more than paint fantastical landscapes in acrylics. He also sketched and painted water colors. Those were wonderful. The second floor of the exhibit displayed the connection between Earle and Disney. Earle worked in Disney's animation department in the 50's, on some of their great animated features, including Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan, and The Lady and the Tramp. I learned a lot about an artist I knew nothing about, and now recognize his hand in 1950's era animation. And, best of all, found new works to enjoy.\nAfter finishing this exhibit, we made our way over to the main museum. The museum focuses on the Disney family from the time they first arrived in America to Disney's untimely death from lung cancer. The exhibit is comprehensive and large. You can follow his early work with the Alice animation through Mickey and on into live action (20,000 Leagues Beneath the Saw) and more. Favorite areas of mine were the sections devoted to Fantasia, the 1964 World's Fair, Disneyland, and Disney World. So much to see and absorb. We ran out of energy before we ran out of things to see.\nThis is a great place to visit for Disney fans, animation fans, and children old enough to absorb what they are looking at (there are areas of hands on experience as well).\nThe art exhibit is a great plus.\nIf you have not visited the Presidio, this is a great excuse.

We both thoroughly enjoyed this museum and would highly recommend it to anyone who is a Disney fan, someone who has fond memories of the Wonderful World of Disney on TV, or anyone who enjoys an inspirational American success story.\n\nWhat I enjoyed about the museum is the cleverness in the way Walt Disney\u2019s personal story is told. Since Walt Disney was such a public figure, he gave many interviews about his life. This exhibit primarily uses actual audio and video of Walt Disney himself to tell his own story. The exhibit includes incredible amount of personal artifacts, letters, photographs, and video. The presentation really helps the visitor understand the unique originality and quality of Walt Disney\u2019s many accomplishments. Almost every aspect of Walt Disney\u2019s career is covered from early animation, feature animated films, true life adventures, feature films, Disneyland, Disney World, and the 1964 World\u2019s Fair in New York. There are so many wonderful surprises in the museum from both Walt Disney\u2019s professional and personal life. I once remember reading that one of Walt Disney\u2019s hobbies was creating a miniature railroad around his home. I was so delighted to see that the exhibit included a large presentation on his miniature railroad, along with his actual locomotive engine, the Lilly Belle, and many of his railroad cars.\n\nI especially enjoyed the Family Insights exhibit that were placed in each room to give the perspective of family members on Walt Disney as a father and husband. My daughter and I spent almost a full 2-hours reading and watching the various exhibits. The facility included a delightful gift shop with many books and items related to Walt Disney as an artist and a small snack bar. Furthermore, the museum often runs special exhibits related to various artists who contributed to Disney animation.\n\nThe only thing that I would caution is that I don\u2019t think this is a museum for young children. I think the person who would enjoy this museum the most would be someone who grew up with the Disney influence in his/her life. The museum is best appreciated by fully reading and watching the many presentations. I really felt that this was a museum for adults who appreciated all that Walt Disney has contributed to entertainment and culture in America.

Plan to bring your own food or don't eat there. There are few other options in the area. The price is very expensive, they were out of almost all of our first and second choice items, so some of us resorted to buying a grilled cheese sandwich that was so done it was starting to turn black or mac and cheese that was microwaved mac with a little cheese sprinkled on top. We watched the guy drop a mac on the floor, spill a second on the counter (accidents happen), and then he was adjusting the mat on the floor but didn't change his rubber gloves before he went back to preparing food. Later, staff were eating themselves behind the counter and didn't change gloves while waiting on more customers. Food service was very slow and so far below any Disney standard I've ever seen or any other food service standard. These were contractors and not Disney staff, but I think the museum should cancel that contract and hire a much better food service company and demand that they make food prices reasonable and food quality and service meet all Disney standards.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed June 25, 2017", 4.0, "Washed with knowledge", "One walks out with deep respect and admiration for Mr. Walt Disney.

There is so much to learn and he packed so much into his life. It sounds like he would have been an incredible employer. We only left a couple hours to visit but if you want to do the museum justice, you could easily spend a full day. It is a lot of reading so I wouldn't recommend this for young children. I saw a couple reviews about no photography. We were told we could take pictures but no flash photography.

After preparing many essays & speeches on the famous Walt, we KNEW we had to see his 'personal' family museum. The museum is just wonderful, although admission is a little pricey and NOT included in the San Fransisco CITY PASS. Walt had always planned to have this museum, so after his death, his daughters followed his wishes & donated their father's prized original drawings, etchings, Oscars, photographs, etc. to create this museum. There are many interactive areas (creating the music for his cartoons) and so many photos to see & side notes to read on 'behind the scene' info. We thoroughly enjoyed it, although I'm not sure a child much younger than 13 years old would. Afterwards, we ate in the cute cafe & although it was a little expensive, it tasted good & was nice to sit & view the Presidio surroundings. Depending on when you go, there might be a school tour so check ahead! LOVED their giftshop! And be sure to use the restrooms in the basement - very cool to see the walls covered in numerous DISNEY Movie Posters from movies as far back as the 1940's! ALSO: this is a little difficult to find!
