Beautiful views of the ocean, great walking area. Good for couples or families to enjoy"], ["Reviewed January 4, 2017", 5.0, "The Westside is the Bestside!", "West Cliff Drive never disappoints. It is magnificent no matter where you start your walk. (assuming you're walking) I live off West Cliff, so I hop on about Fair Avenue. I often walk to Natural Bridges State Park, which is a whole different story, but very easy to walk to as well. The sights are unbelievable at this time of year. We've already seen whales, dolphins, otters, & sea lions to name a few. There are innumerable sea birds to watch as well.\nWalking the other direction you can walk to the lighthouse/Steamer's Lane surf spot where you can witness nature in all of her glory. The crashing waves, the beautiful rock formations, and those prodigious surfers doing what they do best!\nA little further along is the Dream Inn Hotel which has a fun bar/restaurant, Aquarius, where one could pop in for a libation/meal, with a window on the ocean.\nStep out, down the hill and you will find fun for everyone at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed January 2, 2017", 5.0, "Time to surf", "Its a beautiful walk or bike ride after a surf at Steamer Lane for those who know the scene.

You'll get to see surfers, a blowhole (if the waves are big enough), and if you're lucky some dolphins or seals.\n\nThe pathway is flat and well-paved, suitable for walking, running, biking, stroller pushing, and wheelchairs. There are many places to stop and park.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed December 31, 2016", 5.0, "A must-go and must-walk", "West Cliff Drive is a place I never get tired of, even when i lived near Santa Cruz. It's as beautiful as it gets for a town on the ocean (Monterey Bay). It's a relaxing place to take a car picnic, walk, ride bikes, jog, sit on a bench, watch surfers or nap in your car to the sounds of the ocean. The paved walkway is miles long from near Santa Cruz Wharf to Natural Bridges State Park, and is wheelchair accessible, with free parking pullouts scattered the entire length of the drive along the Drive. You can often see whales during certain times of the year. It gets very crowded during holidays and warm weather weekends, but it's always worth spending some time here if you are in Santa Cruz--any time of the year.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed December 31, 2016", 5.0, "Beautiful views", "Enjoy the views of the Pacific ocean and neat ocean front houses.

It is a favorite place for locals and tourists to hit the seaside walking path. You will find plenty of places to park. In December, we needed to bundle-up as the air was crisp, even at midday. This is a perfect place to observe sunsets. The drive is very near to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed December 22, 2016", 4.0, "Beautiful views", "In all fairness we ended up here on a hunt for beautiful Christmas lights. We saw many gorgeous homes overlooking the ocean. During the day it is an inspiring place for a walk."], ["Reviewed December 20, 2016", 5.0, "FANTASTIC views, Great People Watching, Cyclist and foot traffic friendly", "This is a wonderful place to go on a sunny day. It winds from the Boardwalk all the way to Natural Bridges Park. It is a easy ride with no large hills (Except at the very beginning, near the pier, there is one hill that can be a doozy).\n\nThe views are fantastic both ways. On one side you have gorgeous cliff/beach views and on the other you have a wonderful variety of architecture. If neither of those tickle your fancy, you can play fetch on the beach with your pet, or surf the waves. No still? How about fishing on the cliffs? Just sitting on a bench or in your car people watching? The choices are almost limitless here.\n\nTowards the beginning of the Drive, by the peer, there are great places to watch the surfers catch some waves or participate in competitions. There is also a small surf museum you can look around in.\n\nThis is good for cyclists, walkers, joggers, segueing, anything really. Great for families and people of all ages.\n\nBe sure to wear layers as the wind can get intense on the beach. Also, bring water and drink plenty of it. There are no real places to get food on the Drive, so make sure you eat before and bring some snacks. After you have worked up an appetite, make your way back to the pier and eat at one of the restaurants there.\n\nIt can get a bit crowded so be considerate and walk/jog/cycle to the right and keep your dogs close. There are alot of pets on the Drive.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed December 18, 2016", 5.0, "Great Drive , rent a jeep or convertible", "One of the best Drives on the West coast , make to stop and enjoy the secret hidden beaches, nobody was there when we got there, warm up by the fire Etc, great experience"], ["Reviewed December 15, 2016", 5.0, "Gorgeous drive", "This is a fabulous stretch of coast...from the Santa Cruz boardwalk up to natural bridges, it's just beautiful the whole way. There are plenty of places to stop and take pictures. If you're walking or biking, even better! Cute little lighthouses to stop at. Lots of people surfing gives you taste of the local culture.

Lots of good places along roadway to pull over for photo opportunities. The drive was worth the time. It was awe inspiring. It was good that you can travel at your own pace and stop as often as you want to to view the scenes or to take pictures. This would also be great for families with smaller children because they can look for seals and otters along the way in the ocean.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed November 27, 2016", 5.0, "Coast Line Magic", "Perfect drive along the Bay Area coast. Secret beaches, including a nude beach, exist hidden along the coast. Only available by local pathways. You'll find the whale blow hole if the water swell is high enough."]]}}
