If we hadn't had our young kids, I would've done the extended tour, but it was still amazing! I can't wait to go back."], ["Reviewed 2 days ago", 5.0, "39 bucks for 1 hour tour?!", "Was fascinated by the stories behind this place and so it was on my bucket list along with Alcatraz to go. Considering the visit to Alcatraz which includes the short 15 minute ferry ride to and from the island and costs $37.25, this $39 per person for a 1 hour mansion tour seemed a little expensive at first. But unlike Alcatraz, I found out that having your own group tour guide was actually nice, feeding you with interesting stories and guidiing you through the enormous house. If you had any questions he/she can answer them right on the spot. Without a guide, I think it would be impossible to tour on your own anyways because you can easily get lost! After the tour, of course I went to see the movie \"Winchester\", which made me want to go back again!\nTIPS: 1) If you know what time you'll be there, may be wiser to book ahead online. However, if you don't, you should still be able to buy tickets and tour once you get there if you can wait.\n2) Taking pictures is prohibited INSIDE the house, however once your tour is over, you can see the outside area on your own and stay to take pictures OUTSIDE as long as you want.\n3) Not suited for the physically challenged. Too many narrow hallways and stairs.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 2 days ago", 3.0, "Better on the outside than inside", "Understand that this is not a well-furnished palatial place. Exposed 2x4s and open rafters dominate, as does the old-wood, musty smell. The guide was not very engaging. The lighting is dim, stairs many and uneven. Not recommended for people with poor vision. The few furnishings you see are not original to the house, just to the time period, as the niece of the widow carted away everything that was not nailed down, literally. How could anybody live in that maze of useless rooms and convoluted passageways is beyond me. At the end I felt only sadness over how much wealth in money and talent was wasted here. If Sara Winchester was so afraid of the ghosts of the people killed by her husband's weapons, she could have benefited the children and widows in a much more beneficial way and I'd bet the ghosts would have been happy and not hound her to her dying day. The sad part of today is the high price of admission.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 4 days ago", 5.0, "As creepy, and cool as I\u2019d hoped!!", "The place is amazing. You\u2019ve really got to know the story behind it to fully appreciate its mystique.\n\nAs an avid ghost hunter, I totally felt a presence in the house. They were talking about all night ghost hunts they were going to host and I\u2019d love to go back for one. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s haunted.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 5 days ago", 5.0, "Third Visit - Still Fun", "This was my third time touring the Winchester Mystery house but each visit had a wide gap of many years between them. I\u2019d gone once in elementary school with my brother, mother, and grandmother, and the other time with a group of friends for one of the October night time flashlight tours. Over six years later, I wanted to take another tour to see the costumes on display from the new film and experience the new Explore More Tour.\n\nThe Mansion Tour is definitely the better of the two. It\u2019s longer and takes you through the most rooms. But luckily you have to take this tour if you want to do Explore More because it can only be bought as an add on.\n\nOur guide was great and we had a really fun group that was totally into the whole experience. You get to take pictures with Winchester rifles at the beginning of the tour (I think they\u2019re real because they didn\u2019t have the orange cap that fake guns have) which you can buy for $40 at the gift shop. That was really the only thing I didn\u2019t like. I would\u2019ve gladly paid $20 but $40 is waaaaay too steep which is disappointing because they were cool pics.\n\nOne thing that really impressed me is how much has been improved at the mansion since my last visits. The gift shop is nicely revamped, the tour now has sound effects to better transport you back to what the house would\u2019ve felt like, and they added a great video introduction at the beginning of the tour. They have also restored some rooms beautifully that were completely empty and dilapidated last time I was there.\n\nThe Explore More tour felt really short but it was worth taking for me because I\u2019ve always wanted to tour the notoriously haunted basement/boiler room. It is super creepy down there, particularly the hallway where some tour groups see the ghost of someone pushing a wheelbarrow. Sadly no such luck for us. I loved that this gives you access to more places in the house to where by the end of both tours you\u2019ve seen about 98% of the 160 room mansion. You really feel like there isn\u2019t much you could have missed.\n\nIf anyone was wondering about any paranormal experiences we might have had, my husband and I saw the chandelier shaking in the ballroom and the tour guide said a door that isn\u2019t part of the tour was left open but none of these seemed definitively paranormal. I didn\u2019t feel anything when touring other then extremely cold temperatures. However, the house has no heating system and it was 35 degrees in San Jose that morning (come prepared for the cold!). I do, however, believe the place is haunted because, on my flashlight tour years ago, a cabinet in the linen room opened by itself behind me. The guide saw it but I didn\u2019t see or hear it happen - just noticed that it was closed when I walked in and when I turned around it was open.....hmmmmm....You can come decide for yourself if the place is haunted and for a limited time, I\u2019m assuming, check out the costumes from the Winchester film. We got a free movie poster and the guide on the Explore More tour pointed out a lot of the props or rooms where filming took place which was fascinating because I had thought they had only done exterior shots. Definitely worth a visit if you\u2019ve never been!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 1 week ago", 2.0, "What mystery? Over-rated and over-priced.", "We've been curious about this place for years, and with the new movie coming out decided to check it out. It cost our family of 4 (2 kids/2 adults) $126 or the 1 hour mansion tour.\n\nThe tour starts with the guide, in a robotic tone, greeting the tour with \"Don't open any doors. Don't touch anything. No food. Don't lean on the walls.\" Okay...fair enough. The tour continues, and while the guide was informative, she seemed bored and just wanted to run through the motions of a memorized tour script. There was no mystery - just a sad story about Sara Winchester. The closest they got to mysterious was telling us that one of the deceased workers' is a ghost who lived at the house \"has been spotted.\"\n\nThe gouging of tourists with the extreme price here is what earns this place only 2 stars. The tour just shuttles around a large group of over 20 people for an hour. The employees seem bored and uninterested. It was a sad place.\n\nCheck out the Mystery Spot at Santa Cruz, about 45 mins south. Real mysteries (gravity defying...so crazy) and really interesting. This place, unfortunately, is over-hyped and taking advantage of tourists with their ridiculous prices.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 1 week ago", 4.0, "California Vacation", "Though not nearly as glamorous as The Hearst Mansion this house is definitely different in more ways than one can count and worth an exercising visit as there is much walking and stairs to climb. But you will probably never go thru a weirder house unless you have visited the House on the Rock in Wisconsin which is much smaller and more of a weird museum. Can't wait to watch the newly released movie about it. No words to describe this house however--you have to experience it.

It's amazing how much it is now surrounded by developments. But, the house and gardens retain their charm and fascination.\n\nFirst the good, the Winchester House is a peculiar and rich with history as ever. We took the standard tour and it is still thrilling to hear Sarah Winchester's sad story and see the extraordinary home she built.\n\nLess good. First, its very expensive for a 60 minute tour. The main entrance is poorly organized - we waited in line for 10 minutes before someone told us that with pre-booked tickets we should be in a different line. There is no signage to indicate that at all. Our guide was fine, but spoke really quickly, like she was anxious to get the tour over with, which made it hard to hear what she was saying.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was to be told that photography was not allowed inside the house. We were given the excuse that the production company of the new film \"Winchester\" had \"copyrighted\" the interior of the house. I know enough about copyright in my professional life to know this is utter nonsense. I'll bet the film company did not make this claim and the owners of the house are just trying to restrict photography with no legal basis. It's completely unacceptable.

The house itself is fascinating, and although the furniture isn't original, they've done a nice job preserving the interiors in their various states of decay.\n\nThe tour itself was disappointing. While our tour guide seemed very nice, the tour itself was heavily scripted, and very impersonal, playing up the supernatural as opposed to some of the historical facts that are out there via various sources. Group size was large, but manageable, although you always ran the risk of running into other groups.\n\nWe pre-booked the regular tour- the extended one seems to get booked very quickly and we weren't able to get tickets. Parking is limited on site, but there is a parking lot right across the street. There are a few restaurants close by if you need to grab a bite- the cafe menu seemed limited.\n\nOverall, it was a beautiful home- I just wish it didn't feel so commercialized.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 1 week ago", 4.0, "A glimpse into a part of San Jose's history", "I went there last night.

I can't wait to go see the house again as it's been updated, repainted, and certainly of more interest now nationally due to the new movie coming out about the mysterious house and the odd, superstitious, heiress to the Winchester rifle fortune. Mrs.Winchester (played by British actress, Helen Mirren) once widowed, became more eccentric and believed that if she never stopped building on the house that she would never die. There are all kinds of ghost stories about the house too. My big fascination with Mrs. Winchester was that she slept in a different bedroom every night and no one on staff knew which room it would be. The servants had to change ALL the bed linens on ALL the beds in the gigantic house each day---and only then would a servant discover which bedroom she'd slept in.

That was well worth the addition and took the entire adventure from an hour to over two which made it feel that much more worthwhile.\n\nAs for the main tour, our guide was incredibly fun and enthusiastic with a lot of knowledge to share and clearly a lot of passion for what he does. The talking can drag on as you stop for the large groups to catch up but the house is pretty remarkable to wander around and certainly a unique experience for a one time visit (though I would go back for their halloween events I think.)\n\nThe main drawback, price aside, is that you can't take photos.

First, the tour is overpriced at around $40/per adult or $20/per child, and the \"Explore More Tour\" is an additional $10/per person on top of that, coupled with the fact that photography in the house is strictly not allowed, I feel that point eats away at the overall value of the visit. Second, the tour guides are very scripted, painfully so, and they seemed rather off-putting to me; we had one for the main tour, and one for the additional tour.

Its 160 Victorian rooms are echoes of a bygone age ruled by the Gilded elite and served by large and loyal household staffs. However, a lot of the quirks such as a stairwell into the ceiling, doors that open into walls or even a door that opens into empty space from the second floor can easily be chalked up to too much money, incessant construction and poor planning and design. I was really hoping that there would be a few secret rooms or an inter-dimensional portal or two, but was sadly disappointed.\n\nOne also has to keep in mind that the house has been a tourist attraction since 1924, two years after the death of Sarah Winchester, its original owner and designer, in 1922. In 1924, it was appraised at a mere $5000, which might have been a lot in those days, but the $5000 could be redeemed just from the equipment in the pumphouse back then, and the rest of the house was valued as pretty much worthless, despite having cost hundreds of thousands to build. (This assessment is not revealed by the guides, but can be seen in the 1924 newspaper article in the Rifle Museum.)\n\nThe same family has owned the house since 1924, so they've had more than 90 years to build up mystique and mystery for what is essentially an eccentric heiress' private money pit. One has only to look to the gift shop, which is filled with lamentable tchotchkes (of which Mrs. Winchester would probably not have approved) to see how much the attraction owes to savvy marketing rather than historical or even hysterical significance.
