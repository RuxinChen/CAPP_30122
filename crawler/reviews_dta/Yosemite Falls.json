You can just climb the bottom half and get a good picture of the upper falls if you're not up for a grueling day. The climb from that first photo spot to the top is the most strenuous. This is tough on knees and thighs. It's not technical, tons of stairs, but it is strenuous. I highly recommend hiking sticks/poles. They will come in handy.\n\nTip: a great place to relax at the top is to start towards the Point but stop at the bridge and hang out down by the river. Also, if you've made it to the upper falls, you're doing yourself a disservice by not going to the Point, .8 miles further. It isn't as bad of a climb and the views are better but it's adding time to your total hike.\n\nTip: If you are considering either Nevada Falls or Upper Yosemite Falls, Nevada Falls is easier, especially if you use the John Muir trail and you get much closer to the water than Yosemite. Yosemite Falls is the same distance but much harder, more vertical, but the views of the valley are 10x better. You don't get nearly as close to the waters edge at Upper Yosemite.

Due to a late start, we were unable to complete the hike, but we did manage to reach an excellent viewpoint of Upper Yosemite Falls, from which we could see both the falls and Half Dome in the distance. Best of all, there was a double rainbow in the spray of the water!\n\nWe brought plenty of food and water and set off on the hike from the Upper Yosemite Falls stop on the shuttle bus. We found the trail to be unrelenting in its vertical gains. The hike consisted of switchback after switchback, pretty much all uphill for the first 1.5 miles until Columbia Rock. This stretch really kicked our butts because there was no relief from the ascent. When we reached Columbia Rock, we noticed that almost everyone we had seen hiking up ended up turning around and heading back down. This is a real shame, as there are no Yosemite Falls views to be had from Columbia Rock. We took a quick break and then decided to head further along the trail.\n\nThe next part of the trail was a good deal less strenuous, and there were even some downhill parts. Eventually, we rounded a corner and could see Upper Yosemite Falls in all of its glory. We kept on for another 30 minutes or so and eventually came to the view described above. We could feel the spray from the waterfall as we took in the awesome views. At this point, the sun was just about to descend below the valley walls, and we still wanted to visit Glacier Point, so we decided to head back down. We were a little disappointed that we couldn't make it all the way to the top, but we enjoyed the up close views of the waterfall nevertheless.\n\nIf you are interested in a hike similar to ours, here are the details. The round trip hike covered about 5.5 miles and took us just over 5 hours. We arrived at the rainbow viewpoint around 3:30 PM, and we found that the rainbows were already starting to disappear around 4:00 PM (end of July). Had we arrived just an hour later, we wouldn't have gotten any rainbows. Along the way, there were plenty of expansive views over Yosemite Valley. We could not see Lower Yosemite Falls from any of the viewpoints, but Upper Yosemite Falls was a featured view several times.\n\nIf you start this hike and are tempted to turn around at Columbia Rock, try to talk yourself into a little more hiking so you can at least see Upper Yosemite Falls from the trail. You've worked so hard just to get to Columbia Rock, you might as well reward yourself with some waterfall action. You should know that the trail has limited amounts of shade, so it is important to bring sunscreen and lots of water. We carried about 5.5 liters between my wife and I, and we used almost all of it along the trail. The trail was a little slippery in places due to dust, so you might benefit from hiking poles. We saw several folks using them, but we made the hike without them just fine (although we did have our feet slip out from underneath us a few times).\nShow less"], ["Reviewed August 22, 2017", 5.0, "another fantastic part of the national park", "Easy walk to view, this one is accessible by wheel chair in dry weather with someone to assist.

One of the falls that we visited had about 4\" of water on the trail leading to the falls.\nWe visited in the morning during the week and it wasn't too crowded. However as the day went on, it began to get crowded in some of the parking lots. They were doing construction in some of the areas adding to some of the congestion. I would think that during the weekend, it would be very busy and hard to enjoy.\nTake some time to visit our National Parks before the protection for these areas goes away.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 13, 2017", 5.0, "Spectacular day!", "With good rainfall (early 2017), all the falls and streams flowing heavy.

I thought we could at least make it to the base of the falls but there was so much snow and running water that it was not possible because my daughter wore her Sanuks instead of hiking boots.

People are drawn to it like bugs are drawn to a night light. They want to feel the experience."], ["Reviewed May 1, 2017", 5.0, "Upper Yosemite Falls", "This is an epic hike to say the least. Yosemite Valley, with so many iconic views, can be a little intimidating to the inexperienced visitor. What's best to do? What's best to see? What's best to hike? The hike to Upper Yosemite Falls satisfies most of those questions. First off, do not be lulled into a false sense of security when you learn that it's not as strenuous a hike as Half Dome - it will crush the unprepared. Keep the basics in mind; sleep the night before, bring water and food, sunscreen, hat, etc...basics for hiking are usually the same - use your head. That being said, if you want to have a good time on this hike instead of \"making it through\", you need to prepare for it. 1. get in shape. Spend a few months in the gym doing cardio and the stair climber. 2. Invest in some decent gear. Convertible pants, a good hat, a CamelBak, and trekking poles will make the journey easier and more enjoyable.\nThe trail itself is well maintained, scenic, enjoyable, and punishing at times. The switchbacks can be difficult if your not used to them, out of shape, or loaded down with to much gear. Keep an eye on the weather (a couple of days beforehand!) and adjust your wardrobe and gear appropriately. The trail can be quite exposed at times, and if its hot, it can sap the motivation to climb right out of you! As you go along, you will be rewarded with amazing views - really amazing views - and it gets better the higher you go. Great photo opportunities of the falls and valley are found most everywhere along the trail, so you will have to mind how often you stop to take pics if your going up and down in the same day (I was more mindful of this as I completed my hike in May when daylight hours are not as plentiful). After the switchbacks, you start to walk through a beautiful pine grove as you get to the top - which provides very welcome shade. Take your time, because your almost at the lookout. Once there, take off your pack and enjoy the epic view - you've earned it!! There is a short \"trail\" down to a precarious lookout of the Upper Falls which allows you to look down where it falls of the edge - you hiked this far - don't leave without seeing this. If your legs are shaky from the hike, take a minute and relax, you'll need sure footing while walking around up there. After you've seen the lookout and taken a billion pics, follow the trail to the bridge that straddles the river. Many people take their lunch here in this setting - lots of shade, and the sounds of the river are peaceful. I am not promoting this in ANY way, however, I've seen many people take a swim in some of the shallow spots in the river....and I can't blame them!\nAfter you've had your fill, it's time to go back down. For many people, going down is worse than going up - and for this trail, I have to agree. This trail is especially difficult on the return due to the large amount of scree. I was slipping a LOT. And I've got some very good boots...just be careful and take it slow and purposefully. There are some great spots to sit and relax along this trail, so try to linger and soak it up. Your not going to get lost or need to post anything on FB, so put your phone in airplane mode to conserve battery - you'll want to use every last iota of power to take pics! Yosemite Valley shuttle system is great - take it to the trailhead located at the backside of Camp4 to start your hike. Afterwards, go eat and drink something you love and reflect.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 1, 2017", 5.0, "Visit upper and lower falls", "Don't be content with what you can see from afar. Walk up to the place where the Upper Falls stops and the Lower Falls come out.

I could hear the booming of them before I could see them. The power of the water is quite amazing. The path is paved and very wide. Not to be missed."]]}}
