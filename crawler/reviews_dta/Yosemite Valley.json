However, a couple things that I hope can be helpful to someone...the park had flurries all day, so I guess with the prediction of snow showers they were at R1, which requires you to carry snow chains unless you are over 6000 pounds and have all weather snow tires. After deciding we had proper tires and under 6000 pounds we paid to enter. Then, a mile into the park a sham artist is trying to sell chains for $96 and is telling us it's against the law for us not to carry chains in our vehicle. We proceed to tell him it clearly says that they are only required to carry UNLESS you are over 6000 pounds or don't have snow tires, and he got extremely defensive , raised his voice, and told us not to tell him the law and that we would be breaking the law. Thank goodness, we didn't buy them and listen to the con-artist selling snow chains inside the park. We did have flurries all 6 hours in the park. The snow plows were plowing the gravel on the road as there was no snow to plow. I highly recommend Yosemite, even if it's R1, but I can't speak to worse except to buy chains before getting ripped off by the con-artist in the park. As we were exiting the park, it was heavier snow, higher elevation and became R2, and then the snow chains were only $68 in the presence of the park ranger-but he could of also been a different vender-we didn't see the vender as we just decided to exit the park via the low, less snowy road. Just seemed sketch, and then not as sketch when the ranger was present. Get the restrictions ahead of time, if possible, and be educated as to if you need chains or not, and purchase them in town ahead of time.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed 4 days ago", 3.0, "Gunshow Guru", "Went in mid February !

They were more concerned about their employees comfort than the comfort of the their guests. We spent four days in the valley and we were amazed at the lack of hospitality. Restaurants were closed and the ones opened were reminiscent of a school cafeteria. For example, the main restaurant at the lodge did not have water. Instead they gave us a paper cup and told us to fill it up, using the fountain by the bathrooms in the lobby. Temperatures were cold and yet generally they would not build a fire in the fireplaces. The only feed back we got was that kindling was expensive and the wood was frozen. However there was a decorative fire at the deli and ice skating rink. The Awahnee had a deceit fire with a place to seat and enjoy the ambiance. They missed an opportunity to offer warmth and hospitality to the guest by lighting a fire in the game room and ice skating rink in Curry Village. Also at Degnan Deli their larger fireplace remained unused. Only the concessionaire\u2019s convenience was taken into account when they required skaters to walk from the rink to the front desk at Curry Village to buy skating tickets. Then later, when you want the hot cocoa at the warming hut, you have to walk back to the front desk, approximately between 200-300 yards.

And true, unfortunately, the valley filled with smoke quite frequently this past summer. Consider it an adventure. If you are looking for solitude, you might need to take advantage of one of the many long hikes or rock climbs that are not so easy for most folks to do. My wife and I, being older folks now, are pretty much limited to driving and taking easy mile or two hikes, catching a ride on a shuttle. And yet, somehow, we found ourselves standing in meadows, strolling along riverbanks, admiring waterfalls, studying wonderful rock formations, and enjoying the peaceful aspects of nature. Early in the morning and later in the evening are best; the place can sometimes feel empty. You can hear a bear in the bushes, an owl in a tree, the river flowing over rocks. Concentrate the sight, sound, and feel of natural beauty and you will find it here. And as for the many people that seem to share the place at times, there are many worth meeting from everywhere in the world. It's all good unless you are one of those people who want everything to yourself. In which case, by an island and best of luck to you. Yosemite Valley is great, and it offers something to every one of us who is fortunate to visit.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed October 14, 2017", 5.0, "My favourite place ever", "Recently I visited Yosemite and did the trail around the valley and then went up sentinel dome afterwards.

Amazing environment, very informative volunteers, reasonable places to eat, although nothing fancy. And above all fascinating sceneries.\nI would recommend the bike tour. Rentals are reasonably priced at about $33 for the day. It allows you to visit the whole valley at your pace in the day. Bikes are bulky, but the Valley is more or less flat.\nNext advice is the scenery from Road 120, especially the Olmsted point.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 12, 2017", 5.0, "Beautiful", "This national treasure us certainly worth a visit.

My favorite hike is up Vernal falls and Nevada Falls. They have three main parking areas and a shuttle to take you around. As we camped outside the Valley we usual got a parking place in the Valley by 8:30 AM and seemed to get the last ones available. When we were ready to leave there were people waiting for the spots. The shuttles worked well for us. There were wildfires in other parts of the park. Because of that there was a lots smoke in the Valley so ti was her dot see some of the normal sights. The clearest areas were Nevada Falls, Vernal Falls and Mirror lake. The trail to lower Yosemite Falls is easy. There is food and a good store in Yosemite Village. A well as a good visitor center. We got hot showers at Half Dome Village, formerly called Curry Village. The Ahwahnee hotel has changed its name to The Majestic Yosemite Hotel.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 10, 2017", 5.0, "Pretty awesome", "We went via the south entrance from Fresno. You need to set off early as theres quite a few miles through winding roads once youve paid your $30 entrance fee.\nYou will incline to around 6000 feet with stop off's along the way, take packed lunches and plenty of water. Stop at the Belvedere falls, you can take pushchairs as tarmac path takes you to a viewing area, most of the paths are pretty ok for kids in prams. The visitors centre is extremely busy, rarely anywhere to park, we got there around 1pm, it was choc a block. Anyhow theres a one way system that loops around El Capitain and the falls, the map they provide is pretty basic, youl see signs that are not on the map so if you fancy a good recky get a good map. Take your camera and be sure to stop off at all the viewing points, its well worth it. Your ticket lasts a week too, so if you get chance to go back, also take swim stuff especially for the kids, theres a few lovely places to stop and play in the river, its really slow and low in places this time of year, crisp, crystal clear water as is the air! Well worth a visit, a great day out.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 10, 2017", 5.0, "Yosemite Excellence!", "After over 32 years living in California the trip to Yosemite National Park was certainly historic. The panoramic views, the drive, and the waterfall area were magnificent! The timing was very good before the late summer fires became an issue. Words to the wise, if you want to camp or stay at one of the area lodges, reserve well ahead of time and arrive early. If you are taking a day trip, plan to arrive extra early or the wait to enter the park will be extremely long.

It can be quite overcrowded at the viewing platform at times, but hiking through the valley is a much better way of seeing it anyway! Smoke can be an issue but it's a natural process and in many ways demonstrates how the local ecosystem works- if you are a city-dweller with no knowledge of forest-ecology I guess that could be annoying, but otherwise, suck it up!\n\nIt's just an amazing view, one of those must-see sights. The physical Geography is incredible!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 9, 2017", 5.0, "So near and yet so far!", "Yosemite Valley with its majestic peaks especially the distinctive \"Half Dome\" was formed millions of years ago by a massive glacier which covered North America and when it receeded, it left in place a remarkably tranquil and peaceful valley carved by the Tuolome river. It is so far from the hustling, bustling Silicon Valley of Northern California and yet only a short drive away. Consequently it is a popular destination for San Francisco and the Bay area to re-charge their batteries. Just avoid the peak summer months especially weekends when it is over-crowded.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed September 9, 2017", 5.0, "Newbie, not disappointed, despite the smoke", "As a first time visitor to Yosemite, I didn't know exactly what to expect, especially being familiar with the place so well from photographs. I was worried that in the flesh it might be a let down. However, Yosemite does not disappoint: the place is stunning and rivals any other natural scenery I have ever visited. This despite the fact that I missed many of the famous views, as most of the valley was (completely) enveloped in smoke from nearby wildfires.\n\nThe place is large: you really need a car to get there and to get around, as the shuttle buses do not go everywhere. It is 50 minutes drive from the valley to Glacier Point, for example, then the same back. Note that not all roads are open all year.\n\nWorking out the layout of the park and how it operates can also be a bit baffling for the first time visitor: the National Parks Service website is not 100% clear. Also finding a good map is hard (there don't seem to be any maps that come up to Ordnance Survey standard). You need to research hard on the internet to work out what's going on, find a good trail to follow, etc.\n\nA lot of people visit. Even in September, during school term, it was packed. It doesn't matter though: the scenery overwhelms any crowd issues. Don't be wary of going to the popular places: they are popular for good reason.\n\nWe drove to Glacier Point: fantastic view of the smoke! Also walked to the top of Sentinel: easy 20 minutes each way; smokey again. Looked at Bridalveil falls: 5 minutes from carpark, with water even in September. Had food at the Visitor Centre: basic burger but quite tasty and cheap. Got bus to Mirror Lake trail: longer walk, 30 minutes each way, but very scenic spot. Then drove around the valley stopping at the various carparks to take in the classic views.\n\nEntry fee is cheap and they do take credit cards. There is no mobile phone coverage anywhere that I could find - so don't rely on google maps for navigation.\n\nOnly on a day trip from SF: a long drive there and back (on terrible urban highways), but worth every minute.

We drove 7 hours on Labor Day weekend. We noticed that highway 41 was closed due to a fire, thus we drove in via highway 140. The line to get into the park was 4 hours long! Yes 4 hours!!!! The valley was full of smoke from a fire 36 miles away. It took us so long we were there for an hour or so. We went back the next day and we're thrilled that it only took us 2 hours to go in. We had elderly parents and young kids with us and couldn't get there before 10, but we were told that there was no wait at 7 am. Once we got there it was so crowded it was hard to get around. I recommend to avoid summer holidays and weekends.
