However, when I presented my military ID to the park agent, he asked if I was an AZ resident. I told him no and he said \"Only AZ military residents qualify for this discount.\" That soured our outlook right away. AZ state parks folks should change this rule to admit ALL military ID holders at the discounted price.\n\nThe smallish museum, which includes a short film documentary on the area and prison, was interesting and can be inspected in about 30-45 minutes depending on how much you wish to read.\n\nThe prison cells and yards offer a view of the not-so-plush life the convicts endured.

After watching \"3:10 to Yuma\" numerous times with my son, we felt a visit to the Territorial Prison might be just the ticket. Fortunately I think the most famous thing about Yuma is perhaps that movie's title. The same applies to the Territorial Prison. I was disappointed to find out that no one famous was ever housed there. In fact many of the inmates were there for very bizarre reasons, including several ladies. The prison is actually famous for having been such a miserable place to be housed. Of course during that time, incarceration was very different than now. The accommodations were extremely primitive and generally exposed to the extreme weather conditions that occur in Yuma approximately six to eight months out of the year. I can certainly understand why offenders did not want to be sent to the Territorial Prison. It was a great place to repent for your crimes as you suffered in the sun and extremely high temperatures. That being said, visiting the Territorial Prison is worth your while. The prison itself is interesting to walk through with cells that you can view, as well as an attached informational Center with artifacts and stories all about the history of the prison.
