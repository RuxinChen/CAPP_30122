We had intended to go to Zabriskie Point at dawn but a dust storm the previous afternoon and continuing wind changed our plans. We got there between 9 and 10 am and we were lucky that there was a cloud cover and the sun was just peeking out from behind the clouds illuminating Manly Beacon first, before the other areas. It was very dramatic. The access is all paved from the parking lot area and was easy for us, not so active seniors but might be hard for some as it is a little climb to the best viewing area. We passed by the area in the afternoon and noted that there were buses and so many people up on the top viewing area, We were glad we had come fairly early as there were only a very few people sharing out time on top. Put it on your list of top sights.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed April 11, 2017", 5.0, "Best view", "This lookout has gorgeous views of the national park. It was just breathtaking!

If it is not too hike (in Death Valley!?$) and you are strong of legs and lungs, consider a hike down to Golden Canyon. About 2 1/2 miles of up and down trail, it gives you an up close and personal experience - the colors and formations are not to be missed. Ideally, you would have a friend drive down from ZP to the parking lot at Golden Canyon - otherwise you have a long, hard and uphill trip back to the ZP parking lot.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed April 8, 2017", 4.0, "Great sunset view", "Small hill up to the top on a paved walkway(supposedly handicap accessible) but slightly steep, great for pictures all times of day but great sunset views.

If you're lucky enough to have a few clouds in the sky the sunset can be stunning. If you elect to stay until dark you'll be able to see stars like you might never have seen before. I can highly recommend that you stay or at least come back on another occasion when there's a clear night. The path to the viewpoints is a short climb and can be treacherous in the dark, so bring a flashlight for the climb down to the parking light. If you can manage it, bring a light with a red lens to avoid wrecking the dark adaptation of other viewers (and there will be others, I promise).
