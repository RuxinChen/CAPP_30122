I was able to see all of the art up close and read the placards without waiting.\n\nThis Exhibit was $25 and I also purchased the audio tour for another $8. It is too bad that the deYoung does not have additional public or charitable support, because $33 seems like a high price for an average person to spend. There were no discounted tickets via AAA or other affiliations.\n\nThe exhibit with the audio was excellent. I noticed that some of the information on the audio was available to read in the exhibit, but much of it was not. I highly recommend the audio to enhance the enjoyment of this tour.

The setting of the exhibit is very colorful and really sets the mood for enjoying the photos, fashions, album art, concert posters, and other artifacts. The only reason I did not rate this exhibit excellent is because the content was heavily overweighted with concert posters. I almost had the sense that the curator was unable to turn any posters away. There was one room dedicated to the posters, but then the other rooms had so many as well. The scope of the exhibit \"Summer of 1967\" is pretty narrow, which may be the reason that more photos and artifacts weren't found. I'd like to say that the best room was the one that discussed the free store, the clinic, and the diggers. The ideology and philosophies reflected in the written content communicated a sense of the youth and naivete of those who came to San Francisco to be free.\n\nIf you have not been to Haight-Ashbury, it is very near the deYoung.

Scale of the museum is not overwhelming but could easily fill an entire day. Don't hesitate to eat in the on site caf\u00e9. Food was quite good and reasonably priced. Outside seating is available. Unfortunately the Modern and Contemporary galleries were closed on the day of our visit. Museum was well laid out with an easy flow between galleries.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 24, 2017", 3.0, "Average collection, good special exhibits", "My favorite part of the museum is the collection of Polynesian and African art. The rest of the collection is just average. I much prefer their special exhibitions. There is a great view from the roof....you can access without buying a ticket to enter the actual museum. The gift shop is a good one, as are the places to eat. It is across from the California Academy of Sciences, Japanese Tea Garden and in Golden Gate Park, so it is easy to combine with a day in the Park.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 23, 2017", 5.0, "A Must", "Great collections and beautiful building. Our favorite museum in SF. The Summer of Love exhibit was kinda short but very good."], ["Reviewed May 23, 2017", 5.0, "Don't miss this place", "We visited to see the Summer of Love exhibition. We weren't disappointed by either the exhibition or the museum. We spent over 5 hours in the museum and had morning coffee and lunch there. The food was excellent and based on the summer of love experience - palma ham, brie, leaves and strawberries plus a glass of rose. Highly recommended.\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 22, 2017", 5.0, "Spend the whole day!", "We thought we'd zip through this museum on a whirlwind few days in San Francisco. The Summer of Love exhibit was a fun recollection of times gone by. Posters of the time, 1967, were prominent. Psychedelic, wobbly for the eyes. Loved the display of fashions from prominent designers. But it was the installation by Leonardo Drew and the paintings of Stuart Davis that kept us in the museum all day and into the evening. See it while you can!\nShow less"], ["Reviewed May 22, 2017", 5.0, "Summer of Love Exhibit", "My daughter gave me an early Mother's Day gift by taking me to this wonderful exhibit. I loved every moment of it. She made sure we had headphones to hear all the interviews, music, plans and accomplishments.\n\nI loved hearing how the artists wrote their songs, made the posters and fashioned the styles of the 60's. This is a great exhibition and if you get the chance, please see it.\nShow less"]]}}
